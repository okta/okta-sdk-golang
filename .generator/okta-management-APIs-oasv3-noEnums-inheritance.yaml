      As an option to increase org security, Okta supports CAPTCHA services to prevent automated sign-in attempts. You can integrate one of two providers: [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) or [reCAPTCHA v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible).

      The vendor implementations supported by Okta are both invisible. They each run risk-analysis software in the background during user sign in to determine the likelihood that the user is a bot. This risk analysis is based on the settings that you configure with the provider that you choose.

      Before you configure your org to use CAPTCHA, sign in to the vendor of your choice or sign up for an account. For more details, refer to [CAPTCHA integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-captcha).

  - name: LinkedObject
    x-displayName: Linked Objects
    description: |-
      Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the Linked Objects API to represent the relationship.

      1. Create a Linked Object definition such as Manager:Subordinate or Case Worker:Client. These pairs are represented by a `primary` attribute and an `associated` attribute.
      2. Link users together to create the relationship between the two. You create a Linked Object value with a single request that links one `primary` and one `associated` user.

      For each relationship:

      * A user has at most one `primary` link (a user has a single manager), but can have many `associated` links (a user can have many subordinates).
      * A user can be the `primary` in one relationship and the `associated` in another.
      * A user can be both the `primary` and `associated` in the same relationship.

      Okta Expression Language function for [Linked Objects](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#linked-object-function) provides access to the details about a linked user.

      > **Note:** The Linked Objects feature isn't available for OpenID Connect claims.

      ## Example usage

      Okta allows you to create up to 200 Linked Object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many, for example:

      * A manager has many subordinates. Each subordinate has one manager.
      * A sales representative has many customers. Each customer has one sales rep.
      * A case worker has many clients. Each client has one case worker.

      Most organizations have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the Linked Object definition once, and then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

      You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per Linked Object definition. But a user can be assigned to more than one Linked Object definition.

      For example, assume that you've created one Linked Object definition for manager (`primary`) and for subordinates (`associated`):

      * Joe is Frank's manager.
      * Bob is Joe's manager, but Jane's subordinate.
      * Jane is the CEO, so she reports to herself.

      Thus, you can create chains of relationships (Jane > Bob > Joe > Frank) or terminal relationships (Jane is both `primary` and `associated` user).

      Then, if you create another Linked Object relationship for scrum team membership, you could assign relationships to the same four users:

      * Bob is the scrum lead for the Identity Scrum team.
      * Joe and Frank are both contributors to the team.

      Bob can be the `primary` for a Manager:Subordinate, an `associated` user for that same Linked Object definition, and also the `primary` for the Scrumlead:Contributor Linked Object definition.

      To represent a relationship, create a Linked Object definition that specifies a `primary` (parent) relationship and an `associated` (child) relationship, and then add a link in which the appropriate user is assigned to each side of that link type.

      ## Links between User Types

      If you created multiple User Types, they all share the same Linked Object definitions. For example, if you have separate User Types for employees and contractors, a link could designate an employee as the manager for a contractor, with the contractor being a subordinate of that employee.
  - name: LogStream
    x-displayName: Log Streaming
    description: The Log Streaming API provides operations to manage Log Stream configurations for an org. You can configure up to two Log Stream integrations per org.
  - name: NetworkZone
    x-displayName: Network Zones
    description: |-
      The Okta Network Zones API provides operations to manage Zones in your organization. There are two usage Zone types: Policy Network Zones and Blocklist Network Zones. Policy Network Zones are used to guide policy decisions. Blocklist Network Zones are used to deny access from certain IP addresses, locations, proxy types, or Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) before policy evaluation.

      A default system Policy Network Zone is provided in your Okta org. You can use the Network Zones API to modify the default Policy Network Zone or to create a custom Policy or Blocklist Network Zone. When you create your custom Zone, you can specify if the Zone is an IP Zone or a Dynamic Zone. An IP Zone allows you to define network perimeters around a set of IPs, whereas a Dynamic Zone allows you to define network perimeters around location, IP type, and ASNs.
  - name: OrgSetting

  - name: RoleTarget
    x-displayName: Role Targets
    description: |-
      Role targets are a way of defining permissions for admin roles into a smaller subset of Groups or Apps within your org. Targets limit an admin's permissions to a targeted area of the org. You can define admin roles to target Groups, Applications, and Application Instances.

      * **Group targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage only a specified Group. For example, an admin role may be assigned to manage only the IT Group.
      * **App targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage all instances of the specified Apps. Target Apps are Okta catalog Apps. For example, you can have multiple configurations of an Okta catalog App, such as Salesforce or Facebook. When you add a Salesforce or Facebook App as a target, that grants the admin permission to manage all the instances of those Apps and create new instances of them.
      * **App Instance targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage an instance of one App or instances of multiple Apps. App Instances are specific Apps that admins have created in their org. For example, there may be a Salesforce App configured differently for each sales region of a company. When you create an App Instance target, you can assign an admin to manage only two instances of the configured Salesforce Apps and then also to manage an instance of another configured App such as Workday.

      > **Note:** Don't use these operations with a Custom Role ID. Custom Role assignments always require a target Resource Set. See [Role Assignments](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/role-assignment/) for more information.
  - name: Schema
    x-displayName: Schemas
    description: |-
      The Schemas API provides operations to manage custom User profiles as well as endpoints to discover the structure of the Log Stream configuration.

      Okta's [Universal Directory](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_About_Universal_Directory) allows administrators to define custom User profiles for Okta Users and Applications.
      Okta adopts a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) as the schema language to describe and validate extensible User profiles.
      For Log Stream Schemas, Okta uses [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).
      [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is a lightweight declarative format for describing the structure, constraints, and validation of JSON documents.

      > **Note:** Okta implements only a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html). This document describes which parts apply to Okta, and any extensions Okta has made to [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).
  - name: Session
    x-displayName: Sessions
    description: |-
      Okta uses a cookie-based authentication mechanism to maintain a user's authentication Session across web requests. The Okta Sessions API provides operations to create and manage authentication Sessions for users in your Okta organization.

      >**Note:** Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows. See [FAQ: How Blocked Third Party Cookies Can Potentially Impact Your Okta Environment](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/FAQ-How-Blocking-Third-Party-Cookies-Can-Potentially-Impact-Your-Okta-Environment).

      >**Note:** The Sessions API doesn't support direct authentication. Direct authentication is supported through the [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#authentication-operations) or through OIDC using the [Resource Owner Password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/ropassword/main/).

      ### Session cookie

      Okta uses an HTTP session cookie to provide access to your Okta organization and applications across web requests for an interactive user agent such as a web browser. A session cookie has an expiration configurable by an administrator for the organization and is valid until the cookie expires or the user closes the Session (logout) or browser application.

      ### Session token

      A [session token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#session-token) is a one-time bearer token that provides proof of authentication and may be redeemed for an interactive SSO session in Okta in a user agent. Session tokens can only be used **once** to establish a Session for a user and are revoked when the token expires.

      Okta provides a very rich [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) to validate a [user's primary credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#primary-authentication) and secondary [MFA factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#verify-factor). A session token is returned after successful authentication, which can be later exchanged for a session cookie that uses one of the following flows:

      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting the OpenID Connect Authorization Endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-through-the-openid-connect-authorization-endpoint)
      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting a session redirect link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-a-session-redirect-link)
      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting an application embed link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-an-application-embed-link)

      >**Note:** **Session tokens** are secrets and should be protected at rest and during transit. A session token for a user is equivalent to having the user's actual credentials.

    description: The Subscriptions API provides operations to manage email subscription settings for Okta administrator notifications.
  - name: SystemLog
    x-displayName: System Log
    description: |-
      The System Log records system events that are related to your organization in order to provide an audit trail that can be used to understand platform activity and to diagnose problems.

      The System Log API provides near real-time, read-only access to your organization's system log and is the programmatic counterpart of the [System Log UI](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Reports_SysLog).

      The terms "event" and "log event" are often used interchangeably. In the context of this API, an "event" is an occurrence of interest within the system, and a "log" or "log event" is the recorded fact.

      The System Log API supports these primary use cases:
        * Event data export into a security information and event management system (SIEM)
        * System monitoring
        * Development debugging
        * Event introspection and audit

      The System Log API isn't intended for use as a Database as a Service (DBaaS) or to serve data directly to downstream consumers without an intermediate data store.

      See [Events API Migration](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/events-api-migration/) for information on migrating from the Events API to the System Log API.
  - name: Template

  - name: TrustedOrigin
    x-displayName: Trusted Origins
    description: |-
      The Trusted Origins API provides operations to manage Trusted Origins and sources.

      When external URLs are requested during sign-in, sign-out, or recovery operations, Okta checks those URLs against the allowed list of Trusted Origins. Trusted Origins also enable browser-based applications to access Okta APIs from JavaScript (CORS). If the origins aren't specified, the related operation (redirect or Okta API access) isn't permitted.

      You can also configure Trusted Origins to allow iFrame embedding of Okta resources, such as Okta sign-in pages and the Okta End-User Dashboard, within that origin. This is an Early Access feature. To enable it, contact [Okta Support](https://support.okta.com/help/s/).

    get:
      summary: List all Devices
      description: |-
        Lists all devices with pagination support.

        A subset of Devices can be returned that match a supported search criteria using the `search` query parameter.

        Searches for devices based on the properties specified in the `search` parameter conforming SCIM filter specifications (case-insensitive). This data is eventually consistent. The API returns different results depending on specified queries in the request. Empty list is returned if no objects match `search` request.

        > **Note:** Listing devices with `search` should not be used as a part of any critical flows—such as authentication or updates—to prevent potential data loss. `search` results may not reflect the latest information, as this endpoint uses a search index which may not be up-to-date with recent updates to the object. <br> Don't use search results directly for record updates, as the data might be stale and therefore overwrite newer data, resulting in data loss. <br> Use an `id` lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data.

        This operation equires [URL encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). For example, `search=profile.displayName eq "Bob"` is encoded as `search=profile.displayName%20eq%20%22Bob%22`.

        Okta supports filtering on the `id` and `usage` properties. See [Filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter) for more information on the expressions that are used in filtering.
