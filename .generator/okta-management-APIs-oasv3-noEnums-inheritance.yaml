      **Work with the Default Authorization Server**

      Okta provides a pre-configured Custom Authorization Server with the name `default`. This Default Authorization Server includes a basic access policy and rule, which you can edit to control access. It allows you to specify `default` instead of the `authorizationServerId` in requests to it:

      `https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/authorizationServers/default`

  - name: CAPTCHA
    x-displayName: CAPTCHAs
    description: |-
      As an option to increase org security, Okta supports CAPTCHA services to prevent automated sign-in attempts. You can integrate one of two providers: [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) or [reCAPTCHA v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible).

      The vendor implementations supported by Okta are both invisible. They each run risk-analysis software in the background during user sign in to determine the likelihood that the user is a bot. This risk analysis is based on the settings that you configure with the provider that you choose.

      Before you configure your org to use CAPTCHA, sign in to the vendor of your choice or sign up for an account. For more details, refer to [CAPTCHA integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-captcha).

  - name: CustomTemplates
    x-displayName: Custom Email Templates
    description: |-
      These endpoints allow you to programmatically manage email customizations.

      Okta provides many customizable email templates. For example, the `UserActivation` email template allows users to activate their account. Use email customizations to override a template's default content. See the [list of email templates](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#use-customizable-email-templates).

      Each template has default content that Okta translates to any one of the supported languages. The following settings determine the language for emails sent from Okta to a user, if the user hasn't selected a specific display language:
      * The user's locale property value (if specified)
      * The org's display language

      See [Supported languages](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#supported-languages).

      The following constraints apply to email customizations:
      * If an email template has any customizations at all, exactly one of them must be the default (where `isDefault` is `true`). Okta uses the default customization when no other customization applies to the user's language settings.
      * Each email template can have only one customization for each supported language.

      ### Enable other locales
      <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

      Use the [BCP 47 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) to enable more locales than Okta's 27 default languages.

      Once you create a customization with the new locale, the locale appears in the Admin Console along with the default-supported locales.

      Include `null` in the subject or body of the email customization. Okta replaces `null` with a default value based on the following order of priority:

      - An existing default email customization, if one exists
      - Okta-provided translated content for the specified language, if one exists
      - Okta-provided translated content for the brand locale, if it's set
      - Okta-provided content in English

  - name: LinkedObject
    x-displayName: Linked Objects
    description: |-
      Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the Linked Objects API to represent the relationship.

      1. Create a Linked Object definition such as Manager:Subordinate or Case Worker:Client. These pairs are represented by a `primary` attribute and an `associated` attribute.
      2. Link users together to create the relationship between the two. You create a Linked Object value with a single request that links one `primary` and one `associated` user.

      For each relationship:

      * A user has at most one `primary` link (a user has a single manager), but can have many `associated` links (a user can have many subordinates).
      * A user can be the `primary` in one relationship and the `associated` in another.
      * A user can be both the `primary` and `associated` in the same relationship.

      Okta Expression Language function for [Linked Objects](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#linked-object-function) provides access to the details about a linked user.

      > **Note:** The Linked Objects feature isn't available for OpenID Connect claims.

      ## Example usage

      Okta allows you to create up to 200 Linked Object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many, for example:

      * A manager has many subordinates. Each subordinate has one manager.
      * A sales representative has many customers. Each customer has one sales rep.
      * A case worker has many clients. Each client has one case worker.

      Most organizations have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the Linked Object definition once, and then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

      You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per Linked Object definition. But a user can be assigned to more than one Linked Object definition.

      For example, assume that you've created one Linked Object definition for manager (`primary`) and for subordinates (`associated`):

      * Joe is Frank's manager.
      * Bob is Joe's manager, but Jane's subordinate.
      * Jane is the CEO, so she reports to herself.

      Thus, you can create chains of relationships (Jane > Bob > Joe > Frank) or terminal relationships (Jane is both `primary` and `associated` user).

      Then, if you create another Linked Object relationship for scrum team membership, you could assign relationships to the same four users:

      * Bob is the scrum lead for the Identity Scrum team.
      * Joe and Frank are both contributors to the team.

      Bob can be the `primary` for a Manager:Subordinate, an `associated` user for that same Linked Object definition, and also the `primary` for the Scrumlead:Contributor Linked Object definition.

      To represent a relationship, create a Linked Object definition that specifies a `primary` (parent) relationship and an `associated` (child) relationship, and then add a link in which the appropriate user is assigned to each side of that link type.

      ## Links between user types

      If you created multiple user types (see [User Types](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/)), they all share the same Linked Object definitions. For example, if you have separate user types for employees and contractors, a link could designate an employee as the manager for a contractor, with the contractor being a subordinate of that employee.

      ## Link definition operations

      Link definition operations allow you to manage the creation and removal of the link definitions. If you remove a link definition, links based on that definition are unavailable.

      > **Note:** Links reappear if you recreate the definition. However, Okta is likely to change this behavior so that links don't reappear. Don't rely on this behavior in production environments.

      The Network Zones API provides operations to manage system default and custom zones in your Okta org.
      Network Zones are configurable boundaries that you can use to grant or restrict access to resources in your organization.
      They're used for two purposes:
      * `POLICY`: Network Zones used to guide policy decisions
      * `BLOCKLIST`: Network Zones used to deny access from certain IP addresses, locations, Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), proxy types, or IP service categories before policy evaluation
      > **Note:** The Network Zone blocklist applies to all URLs for the org.

      See [Network zones](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Security_Network) in the Okta product documentation.

      Your Okta org provides the following default system Network Zones that you can modify and use:
      * `LegacyIpZone`: The system default IP Network Zone
      * `BlockedIpZone`: The system default IP Blocklist Network Zone
      * `DefaultEnhancedDynamicZone`: The system default Enhanced Dynamic Network Zone

      You can create and use the following custom Network Zones:
      * IP Network Zone (`IP`): Allows you to define network perimeters around a set of IPs
      * Dynamic Network Zone (`DYNAMIC`): Allows you to define network perimeters around location, IP type, or ASNs
      * Enhanced Dynamic Network Zone (`DYNAMIC_V2`): Extends the Dynamic Network Zone and allows you to include or exclude specific locations, ASNs, or IP service categories

      > **Notes:**
      > * To create multiple Network Zones, you must have Adaptive MFA enabled in your Okta org.
      > * Enhanced Dynamic Network Zones is a [self-service Early Access (EA)](/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature.

      Okta uses the [Shared Signals Framework (SSF)](https://sharedsignals.guide/) to receive security-related events and other data-subject signals from third-party security vendors. In this scenario, commonly used terms for third-party vendors that send signals are "transmitters", Okta is the "receiver", and the connection between the two entities is referred to as a "stream."

      The SSF Receiver API allows you to manage SSF vendor stream configurations between the transmitter and Okta. A stream is configured by [creating a Security Events Provider](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/#tag/SSFReceiver/operation/createSecurityEventsProviderInstance) object in your Okta org. You can create a Security Events Provider object in Okta with a published well-known URL or an issuer-and-JWKS combination.

      After the Security Events Provider object is created for a transmitter, the provider can use the [SSF Security Event Tokens](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFSecurityEventToken/) API to publish events to Okta. While the SSF allows ingestion through push and poll-based operations, Okta currently supports only push-based operations.

      The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) Security Event Tokens API allows third-party security event providers to send Security Event Tokens (SETs) to Okta. The provider must be configured in Okta as a Security Events Provider instance before transmitting a SET to Okta. See [Create a Security Events Provider](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/#tag/SSFReceiver/operation/createSecurityEventsProviderInstance). After the token is verified, any appropriate action is performed upon ingestion.

      Okta uses the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) defined by the [OpenID Shared Signals and Events Framework specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html). A risk signal is ingested as a Security Event Token (SET), a type of JSON Web Token (JWT) that must comply with the SET standard: [RFC 8417 - Security Event Token(SET)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417). The `security.events.provider.receive_event` System Log event is created when a SET is published to Okta successfully.

      Okta's [Universal Directory](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_About_Universal_Directory) allows administrators to define custom User profiles for Okta Users and Applications.
      Okta adopts a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) as the schema language to describe and validate extensible User profiles.
      For Log Stream Schemas, Okta uses [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).
      [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is a lightweight declarative format for describing the structure, constraints, and validation of JSON documents.

      > **Note:** Okta implements only a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html). This document describes which parts apply to Okta, and any extensions Okta has made to [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).

      ### Unique Attributes
      You can enforce uniqueness for custom properties in Okta user profiles or the Okta group profile, such as an employee identification number. You can declare a maximum of five unique properties for each user type and five unique properties in the Okta group profile. Different user types can have the same or different unique properties (up to the limit of five per type).

      Unique properties in Okta user profiles share a single namespace across all [user types](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/) in an org. If user types A and B both contain the property `ice cream` and you identify it as unique in both profiles, then if a user of type A has the value `chocolate`, no other users of type A or B (or any other user type that declares `ice cream` as unique) can have that value.

      Properties that aren't unique also aren't tracked for uniqueness. Suppose the property `candy` is unique in type E and not unique in type F. If a user of type E has the value `caramel` for the `candy` property, no other users of type E can also have the value `caramel`, but any number of users of type F can already have or later be assigned the value `caramel`. Furthermore, because `candy` is not unique in type F, any values users of type F may have are not considered when enforcing uniqueness for users of type E. No matter how many users of type F already have the value `cotton`, it might be assigned to a user of type E as long as no other such user already has that value.

      If you attempt to create or update a user with a duplicate value for a custom user property with a uniqueness restriction, the user creation or update operation fails. The user isn't created or updated until you enter a unique value. Similarly, creating or updating a group fails when the request contains a value for a unique custom group property that is duplicated by another group.

      `null` values don't enter into the uniqueness calculation. If the unique property isn't also specified as being required, you can also omit the value entirely. Multiple users or groups can omit the property and not violate uniqueness.

      To enforce uniqueness for custom properties, you can either add new unique custom properties or update existing custom properties to be unique.

      #### Add new unique custom property

      You can use the [add property to user profile schema](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateUserProfile) request or the [add property to group profile schema](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateGroupSchema) request to add one or more unique custom user or group properties. Specify `"unique": true` on the properties to be marked as unique. The response shows the properties with `"unique": "UNIQUE_VALIDATED"` and uniqueness is then enforced on those properties.

      #### Update existing custom property to be unique

      You can use the [update user profile schema property](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateUserProfile) request or the [update group profile schema property](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateGroupSchema) request to mark existing custom user or group properties as unique by specifying `"unique": true` on the properties to be marked as unique.

      After the request to mark existing custom properties as unique is submitted, an asynchronous validation check is performed to make sure that there are no existing duplicate entries. If you have a significant number of users or groups, the validation can take some time.

      A uniqueness status of `"unique": "PENDING_UNIQUENESS"` indicates that the validation check is still in progress. Use the Universal Directory page in the Admin Console (**Directory** > **Directory Integrations**) to track the status of the validation check. After the validation completes, if you submit a retrieve user schema request or a retreive group schema request, the property's uniqueness status changes to `UNIQUE_VALIDATED` if no duplicate records are found, and uniqueness is then enforced on that property. Otherwise, if duplicate records are found, the `unique` attribute of the schema property isn't shown in the get schema request and uniqueness isn't enforced on the schema property.

      #### Update existing unique custom property to be non-unique

      You can use the [update user profile schema property](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateUserProfile) request or the [update group profile schema property](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/updateGroupSchema) request to change existing unique custom user or group properties to be non-unique by specifying `"unique": false` on the properties to be changed to non-unique. The response shows the properties without the `unique` attribute and the uniqueness constraint is then removed on those properties.

      **Note:** If multiple user types declare a property as unique and you remove the uniqueness constraint on one type, there may be a delay before users of other types that declare the property as unique can be assigned values formerly held by users of the first type.
  - name: Session

      Okta uses a cookie-based authentication mechanism to maintain a user's authentication Session across web requests. The Okta Sessions API provides operations to create and manage authentication Sessions for users in your Okta organization.

      >**Notes:**
      > * Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows. See [Mitigate the impact of third-party cookie deprecation](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-third-party-cookies).
      > * The Sessions API doesn't support direct authentication. Direct authentication is supported through the [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#authentication-operations) or through OIDC using the [Resource Owner Password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/ropassword/main/).

      ### Session cookie

      Okta uses an HTTP session cookie to provide access to your Okta organization and applications across web requests for an interactive user agent such as a web browser. A session cookie has an expiration configurable by an administrator for the organization and is valid until the cookie expires or the user closes the Session (logout) or browser application.

      ### Session token

      A [session token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#session-token) is a one-time bearer token that provides proof of authentication and may be redeemed for an interactive SSO session in Okta in a user agent. Session tokens can only be used **once** to establish a Session for a user and are revoked when the token expires.

      Okta provides a very rich [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) to validate a [user's primary credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#primary-authentication) and secondary [MFA factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#verify-factor). A session token is returned after successful authentication, which can be later exchanged for a session cookie that uses one of the following flows:

      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting the OpenID Connect Authorization Endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-through-the-openid-connect-authorization-endpoint)
      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting a session redirect link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-a-session-redirect-link)
      - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting an application embed link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-an-application-embed-link)

      >**Note:** **Session tokens** are secrets and should be protected at rest and during transit. A session token for a user is equivalent to having the user's actual credentials.

      The terms "event" and "log event" are often used interchangeably. In the context of this API, an "event" is an occurrence of interest within the system, and a "log" or "log event" is the recorded fact.

      The System Log API supports these primary use cases:
        * Event data export into a security information and event management system (SIEM)
        * System monitoring
        * Development debugging
        * Event introspection and audit

    description: |-
      The SMS Templates API provides operations to manage custom SMS templates for verification.

      > **Note:** Only SMS custom Templates are available through the API.

      SMS Templates customize the SMS message that is sent to users. One default SMS Template is provided. All custom Templates must have the variable `${code}` as part of the text. The `${code}` variable is replaced with the actual SMS code when the message is sent. Optionally, you can also use the variable `${org.name}`. If a Template contains `${org.name}`, it is replaced with the organization name before the SMS message is sent.

      ### SMS Template macros

      Only two macros are supported for SMS Templates:

      | <div style="width:200px">Type</div> | Description   |
      | -------------------- | ----------- |
      | ${code}  | The one-time verification code that's required for a user to sign in. |
      | ${org.name} | The Okta org name that the user is trying to authenticate into. |

      >**Note:** The length of your SMS message can't exceed 160 characters. If the verification code portion of the message falls outside of the 160-character limit, your message isn't sent.

      These endpoints allow you to customize the look and feel of pages and templates, including the following:
      * The Okta-hosted sign-in page
      * The sign-out page
      * Error pages
      * Email templates
      * The Okta End-User Dashboard

      Each new org contains Okta default branding. You can upload your own assets (colors, background image, logo, and favicon) to replace the default assets. Then you can publish these assets directly to your pages and templates.

      The Trusted Origins API provides operations to manage Trusted Origins and sources.

      When external URLs are requested during sign-in, sign-out, or recovery operations, Okta checks those URLs against the allowed list of Trusted Origins. Trusted Origins also enable browser-based applications to access Okta APIs from JavaScript (CORS). If the origins aren't specified, the related operation (redirect or Okta API access) isn't permitted.

      You can also configure Trusted Origins to allow iFrame embedding of Okta resources, such as Okta sign-in pages and the Okta End-User Dashboard, within that origin.

See [Create an authenticator enrollment policy](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-create-mfa-policy).\nBased on the group memberships that are specified when the user is created, a password may or may not be required to make the user's status `ACTIVE`.\n\nIf the enrollment policy that applies to the user (as determined by the groups assigned to the user) specifies that the Password authenticator is `required`, then in the case where the user is created without a password, the user is in the `PROVISIONED` status and\na One-Time Token is sent to the user through email. If the user is created with a password, then their status is set to ACTIVE, and they can immediately sign in using their Password authenticator.\n\nIf the enrollment policy that applies to the groups specified for the newly created user indicates that password is `optional` or `disabled`, then the Administrator can't specify a password for the user. Instead, the user status is set to `ACTIVE` and the user can immediately sign in using their Email authenticator. If policy permits, and the user so chooses, they can enroll a password after they sign in.\n\n#### Create user without credentials\n\nCreates a user without a `password` or a `recovery question & answer`.\n\nIf appropriate, when the user is activated, an email is sent to the user with an activation token that the user can use to complete the activation process.\nThis is the default flow for new user registration using the administrator UI.\n\n#### Create user with recovery question\n\nCreates a user without a `password`.\n\nWhen the user is activated, an email is sent to the user with an activation token that can be used to complete the activation process.\nThis flow is useful if migrating users from an existing user store.\n\n#### Create user with password\n\nCreates a user without a `recovery question & answer`.\n\nThe new user is able to sign in after activation with the assigned password. This flow is common when developing a custom user registration experience.\n> **Important:** Do not generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an assigned password.  Users should sign in with their assigned password.\n\n#### Create User with imported hashed password\n\nCreates a user with a specified `hashed password`.\n\nThe new user is able to sign in after activation with the specified password.\n\nThis flow is common when migrating users from another data store in cases where we want to allow the users to retain their current passwords.\n> **Important:** Do not generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an imported password. Users should login with their imported password.\n\n#### Create user with password import inline hook\n\nCreates a user with a `Password Hook` object specifying that a password inline hook should be used to handle password verification.\n\nThe password inline hook is triggered to handle verification of the end user's password the first time the user tries to sign in, with Okta calling the password inline hook to check that the password the user supplied is valid. If the password is valid, Okta stores the hash of the password that was provided and can authenticate the user independently from then on. See [Password import inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/password-hook/) for more details.\n\nThe new user is able to sign in after activation with the valid password. This flow supports migrating users from another data store in cases where we wish to allow the users to retain their current passwords.\n> **Important:** Don't generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an password inline hook. Users should sign in with their existing password to be imported using the password import inline hook.\n\n#### Create user with password & recovery question\n\nCreates a new user with a `password` and `recovery question & answer`.\n\nThe new user is able to log in with the assigned password after activation. This flow is common when developing a custom user-registration experience.\n> **Important:** Don't generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an assigned password. Users should login with their assigned password.\n\n#### Create user with authentication provider\n\nCreates a new passwordless user with a `SOCIAL` or `FEDERATION` authentication provider that must be authenticated via a trusted Identity Provider.\n\n#### Create user in Group\n\nCreates a user that is added to the specified groups upon creation.\n\nUse this in conjunction with other create operations for a Group Administrator that is scoped to create users only in specified groups.  The request may specify up to 20 group ids.  (This limit applies only when creating a user.  The user may later be added to more groups.)\n\n#### Create user with non-default user type\n\nCreates a user with a specified user type (see [User Types](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/user-types)). The type specification may be included with any of the above Create user operations; this example demonstrates creating a user without credentials.\nThe user type determines which [Schema](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/) applies to that user. After a user has been created, the user can be assigned a different user type only by an admin via a full replacement [PUT operation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/user-types/#update-user-type).\n\n### Links object\n\nThe links object specifies link relations. See [`_links`](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers!c=200&path=_links&t=response).\n\n> **Note:** This links object is different from [Linked Objects](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/LinkedObject/).\n\n#### Individual users versus collection of users\n\nFor an individual user result, the links object contains a full set of link relations available for that user as determined by your policies. For a collection of users, the links object contains only the `self` link. Operations that return a collection of users include [List all users](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers) and [List all member users](openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroupUsers).\n\nThe following table shows some links that may be available on a user, as determined by your policies:\n\n|   Link Relation Type   |                                                  Description                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|self\t                   |  A self-referential link to this user                                                                                                                                               |\n|activate\t               |  Lifecycle action to [activate the user](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/activateUser)                                           |\n|deactivate              |\tLifecycle action to [deactivate the user](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/deactivateUser)                                       |\n|suspend                 |\tLifecycle action to [suspend the user](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/suspendUser)                                             |\n|unsuspend               |\tLifecycle action to [unsuspend the user](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/unsuspendUser)                                         |\n|resetPassword           |\tLifecycle action to [trigger a password reset](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/resetPassword)                                             |\n|expirePassword          |\tLifecycle action to [expire the user's password](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/expirePassword)                                          |\n|resetFactors            |\tLifecycle action to [reset all MFA factors](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/resetFactors)                                       |\n|unlock                  |\tLifecycle action to [unlock a locked-out user](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/unlockUser)                                      |\n|forgotPassword          |\t[Resets a user's password](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/forgotPassword) by validating the user's recovery credential.                  |\n|changePassword          |\t[Changes a user's password](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/changePassword) validating the user's current password                        |\n|changeRecoveryQuestion  |\t[Changes a user's recovery credential](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/changeRecoveryQuestion) by validating the user's current password  |"

    description: |-
      The Factors API provides operations to enroll, manage, and verify factors for multifactor authentication (MFA). Generally, authentication involves verifying a different one-time passcode (OTP). Manage both administration and end-user accounts, or verify an individual factor at any time.
      Okta supports several different types of Factors:

      | Factor Type           | Description |
      |-----------------------|-------------|
      | `call`                | Software OTP sent using a voice call to a registered phone number |
      | `sms`                 | Software OTP sent using SMS to a registered phone number |
      | `email`               | Software OTP sent using email |
      | `question`            | Additional knowledge-based security question |
      | `push`                | Out-of-band verification using a push notification to a device and transaction verification with digital signature |
      | `token`               | Software or hardware OTP sent to a device |
      | `token:hardware`      | Hardware OTP sent to a device |
      | `token:hotp`          | Custom [TOTP](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6238.txt) factor that uses an extension of the HMAC-based one-time passcode (HOTP) algorithm |
      | `token:software:totp` | Software time-based one-time passcode (TOTP) |
      | `u2f`                 | Hardware Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) device |
      | `web`                 | HTML inline frame (iframe) for embedding verification from a third party |

  - name: UserGrant
    x-displayName: User Grants
    description: |-
      The User Grants API provides operations to manage user consent Grants in your org.

      A consent represents a user's explicit permission to allow an app to access resources protected by scopes. Consent grants are different from tokens because a consent can outlast a token, and there can be multiple tokens with varying sets of scopes derived from a single consent. When an application comes back and needs to get a new access token, it may not need to prompt the user for consent if they've already consented to the specified scopes. Consent grants remain valid until the user manually revokes them, or until the user, application, authorization server or scope is deactivated or deleted.

      > **Hint:** For all grant operations, you can use `me` instead of the `userId` in an endpoint that contains `/users`, in an active session with no SSWS token (API token). For example: `https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users/me/grants` returns all the grants for the active session user.

        Adds a new JSON Web Key to the client’s JSON Web Keys. 
        > **Note:** This API doesn't allow you to add a key if the existing key doesn't have a `kid`. This is also consistent with how the [Dynamic Client Registration](/openapi/okta-oauth/oauth/tag/Client/) or [Applications](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Application/) APIs behave, as they don't allow the creation of multiple keys without `kids`.

      description: |-
        Assigns an app to an [authentication policy](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Policy/), identified by `policyId`.
        If the app was previously assigned to another policy, this operation replaces that assignment with the updated policy identified by `policyId`.

        > **Note:** When you [merge duplicate authentication policies](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-merge-auth-policies),
        the policy and mapping CRUD operations may be unavailable during the consolidation. When the consolidation is complete, you receive an email with merged results.

        Unassigns a user from an app

        For directories like Active Directory and LDAP, they act as the owner of the user's credential with Okta delegating authentication (DelAuth) to that directory.
        If this request is successful for a user when DelAuth is enabled, then the user is in a state with no password. You can then reset the user's password.

        > **Important:** This is a destructive operation. You can't recover the user's app profile. If the app is enabled for provisioning and configured to deactivate users, the user is also deactivated in the target app.

        Rotates the current Keys for a Custom Authorization Server. If you rotate Keys, 
        the `ACTIVE` Key becomes the `EXPIRED` Key, the `NEXT` Key becomes the `ACTIVE` Key, 
        and the Custom Authorization Server immediately begins using the new active 
        Key to sign tokens.

        > **Note:** Okta rotates your Keys automatically in `AUTO` mode. You can rotate Keys 
        yourself in either mode. If Keys are rotated manually, you should invalidate any intermediate cache 
        and fetch the Keys again using the Keys endpoint.

      description: |-
        Lists all devices with pagination support.
        You can return a subset of Devices that match a supported search criteria using the `search` query parameter.
        Searches for devices based on the properties specified in the `search` parameter conforming SCIM filter specifications (case-insensitive). This data is eventually consistent. The API returns different results depending on specified queries in the request. Empty list is returned if no objects match `search` request.
        > **Note:** Listing devices with `search` should not be used as a part of any critical flows—such as authentication or updates—to prevent potential data loss. `search` results may not reflect the latest information, as this endpoint uses a search index which may not be up-to-date with recent updates to the object. <br> Don't use search results directly for record updates, as the data might be stale and therefore overwrite newer data, resulting in data loss. <br> Use an `id` lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data.
        This operation requires [URL encoding](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1). For example, `search=profile.displayName eq "Bob"` is encoded as `search=profile.displayName%20eq%20%22Bob%22`.

      summary: Create an Event Hook
      description: |-
        Creates a new event hook for your organization in `ACTIVE` status. You pass an event hook object in the JSON payload
        of your request. That object represents the set of required information about the event hook you're registering, including:
          * The URI of your external service
          * The [events](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/) in Okta you want to subscribe to
          * An optional event hook filter that can reduce the number of event hook calls. This is a self-service Early Access (EA) feature.
            See [Create an event hook filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#create-an-event-hook-filter).

            Additionally, you can specify a secret API key for Okta to pass to your external service endpoint for security verification. Note that the API key you set here is unrelated to the Okta API token
        you must supply when making calls to Okta APIs. Optionally, you can specify extra headers that Okta passes to your external
        service with each call.
        Your external service must use a valid HTTPS endpoint.

        Verifies that the event hook matches the provided `eventHookId`. To verify ownership, your endpoint must send information back to Okta in JSON format. See [Event hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#one-time-verification-request).

        Only `ACTIVE` and `VERIFIED` event hooks can receive events from Okta.

        If a response is not received within 3 seconds, the outbound request times out. One retry is attempted after a timeout or error response.

      summary: Update a Feature lifecycle
      description: |-
        Updates a feature's lifecycle status. Use this endpoint to enable or disable a feature for your org.

        Use the `mode=force` parameter to override dependency restrictions for a particular feature. Normally, you can't enable a feature if it has one or more dependencies that aren't enabled.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while enabling a feature, Okta first tries to enable any disabled features that this feature may have as dependencies. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependencies that need to be enabled before the feature is enabled, a 400 error is returned.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while disabling a feature, Okta first tries to disable any enabled features that this feature may have as dependents. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependents that need to be disabled before the feature is disabled, a 400 error is returned.

        The following chart shows the different state transitions for a feature.

      summary: List all Groups
      description: |-
        Lists all Groups with pagination support.

        The number of Groups returned depends on the specified [`limit`](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups!in=query&path=limit&t=request), if you have a search, filter, and/or query parameter set, and if that parameter is not null. We recommend using a limit less than or equal to 200.

        A subset of Groups can be returned that match a supported filter expression, query, or search criteria.

        > **Note:** Results from the filter or query parameter are driven from an eventually consistent datasource. The synchronization lag is typically less than one second.
        See [Filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter) for more information on expressions.

            Don't write code that depends on the default or maximum value, as it might change. If you receive an `HTTP 500` status code, you likely exceeded the request timeout. Retry your request with a smaller `limit` and [page the results](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination).

            The Okta default Everyone group isn't returned for users with a Group Admin role.

            Search currently performs a `startsWith` match but it should be considered an implementation detail and might change without notice in the future. This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination).

            This operation searches many properties:
                * Any group profile property, including imported app group profile properties.
                * The top-level properties `id`, `created`, `lastMembershipUpdated`, `lastUpdated`, and `type`.

        Assigns a [standard role](/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#standard-roles) to a Group.

        You can also assign a custom role to a Group, but the preferred method to assign a custom role to a Group is to create a binding between the Custom Role, the Resource Set, and the Group. See [Create a Role Resource Set Binding](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/#tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/operation/createResourceSetBinding).

        > **Notes:**
        > * The request payload is different for standard and custom role assignments.
        > * For IAM-based standard role assignments, use the request payload for standard roles. However, the response payload for IAM-based role assignments is similar to the custom role's assignment response.

         The response is a [Key object](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/hook-keys/#key-object) that represents the 
         key that you create. The `id` property in the response serves as the unique ID for the key, which you can specify when

         details of the public key data in a separate call.

        Creates a new Identity Provider integration.

        #### SAML 2.0 Identity Provider

        You must first add the IdP's signature certificate to the IdP key store before you can add a SAML 2.0 IdP with a `kid` credential reference. 

        Don't use `fromURI` to automatically redirect a user to a particular app after successfully authenticating with a third-party IdP. Instead, use SAML deep links. Using `fromURI` isn't tested or supported. For more information about using deep links when signing users in using an SP-initiated flow, see [Understanding SP-Initiated Login flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/#understanding-sp-initiated-login-flow).

        Use SAML deep links to automatically redirect the user to an app after successfully authenticating with a third-party IdP. To use deep links, assemble these three parts into a URL:

        * SP ACS URL<br>
        For example: `https://${yourOktaDomain}/sso/saml2/:idpId`
        * The app to which the user is automatically redirected after successfully authenticating with the IdP <br>
        For example: `/app/:app-location/:appId/sso/saml`
        * Optionally, if the app is an outbound SAML app, you can specify the `relayState` passed to it.<br>
        For example: `?RelayState=:anyUrlEncodedValue`

        The deep link for the above three parts is:<br>
        `https://${yourOktaDomain}/sso/saml2/:idpId/app/:app-location/:appId/sso/saml?RelayState=:anyUrlEncodedValue`

        #### Smart Card X509 Identity Provider

        You must first add the IdP's server certificate to the IdP key store before you can add a Smart Card `X509` IdP with a `kid` credential reference. 
        You need to upload the whole trust chain as a single key using the [Key Store API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProviderKeys/#tag/IdentityProviderKeys/operation/createIdentityProviderKey).
        Depending on the information stored in the smart card, select the proper [template](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#idp-user-profile) `idpuser.subjectAltNameEmail` or `idpuser.subjectAltNameUpn`.

        Creates an inline hook

        This endpoint creates an inline hook for your org in an `ACTIVE` status. You need to pass an inline hooks object in the JSON payload of your request. 
        That object represents the set of required information about the inline hook that you're registering, including:

        * The URI of your external service endpoint
        * The type of inline hook you're registering
        * The type of authentication you're registering

        There are two authentication options that you can configure for your inline hook: HTTP headers and OAuth 2.0 tokens.

        HTTP headers let you specify a secret API key that you want Okta to pass to your external service endpoint (so that your external service can check for its presence as a security measure).

        >**Note:** The API key that you set here is unrelated to the Okta API token you must supply when making calls to Okta APIs.

        You can also optionally specify extra headers that you want Okta to pass to your external service with each call.

        To configure HTTP header authentication, see parameters for the `config` object.

        OAuth 2.0 tokens provide enhanced security between Okta and your external service. You can configure these tokens for the following types&mdash;client secret and private key.

        >**Note:** Your external service's endpoint needs to be a valid HTTPS endpoint. The URI you specify should always begin with `https://`.

        The total number of inline hooks that you can create in an Okta org is limited to 50, which is a combined total for any combination of inline hook types.

        Executes the inline hook that matches the provided `inlineHookId` by using the request body as the input. This inline hook sends the provided 
        data through the `channel` object and returns a response if it matches the correct data contract. Otherwise it returns an error. You need to 
        construct a JSON payload that matches the payloads that Okta would send to your external service for this inline hook type.

        A timeout of three seconds is enforced on all outbound requests, with one retry in the event of a timeout or an error response from the remote system. 
        If a successful response isn't received after the request, a 400 error is returned with more information about what failed.

      description: |-
        Replaces the Log Stream object properties for a given ID.

        This operation is typically used to update the configuration of a Log Stream.
        Depending on the type of Log Stream you want to update, certain properties can't be modified after the Log Stream is initially created.
        Use the [Retrieve the Log Stream Schema for the schema type](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/getLogStreamSchema) request to determine which properties you can update for the specific Log Stream type.
        Log Stream properties with the `"writeOnce" : true` attribute can't be updated after creation.
        You must still specify these `writeOnce` properties in the request body with the original values in the PUT request.

        > **Note:** You don't have to specify properties that have both the `"writeOnce": true` and the `"writeOnly": true` attributes in the PUT request body. These property values are ignored even if you add them in the PUT request body.

      summary: Update a User Schema
      description: |-
        Updates a User Schema. This updates, adds, or removes one or more profile properties in a User Schema. 

        Unlike custom User Profile properties, limited changes are allowed to base User Profile properties (permissions, nullability of the `firstName` and `lastName` properties, or pattern for `login`). A property cannot be removed from the default Schema if it is being referenced as a [matchAttribute](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProvider/) in SAML2 IdPs. Currently, all validation of SAML assertions is only performed against the default user type.

        Sends multiple IP risk events to Okta.
        This request is used by a third-party risk provider to send IP risk events to Okta. The third-party risk provider needs to be registered with Okta before they can send events to Okta. See [Risk Providers](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RiskProvider/).
        This API has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute. You can include multiple risk events (up to a maximum of 20 events) in a single payload to reduce the number of API calls. Prioritize sending high risk signals if you have a burst of signals to send that would exceed the maximum request limits.

        Creates an SSF Stream for an event receiver to start receiving security events in the form of Security Event Tokens (SETs) from Okta.

        An SSF Stream is associated with the Client ID of the OAuth 2.0 access token used to create the stream. The Client ID is provided by Okta for an [OAuth 2.0 app integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Apps_App_Integration_Wizard-oidc). One SSF Stream is allowed for each Client ID, hence, one SSF Stream is allowed for each app integration in Okta.

        A maximum of 10 SSF Stream configurations can be created for one org.

            This might not deliver optimal performance for large orgs, and is deprecated for such use cases. To ensure optimal performance, use a [`search` parameter](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers!in=query&path=search&t=request) instead.

            Use the `q` parameter for a simple lookup of users by name, for example when creating a people picker. The value of `q` is matched against `firstName`, `lastName`, or `email`. This performs a `startsWith` match, but this is an implementation detail and can change without notice. You don't need to specify `firstName`, `lastName`, or `email`.

          description: |-
            Filters users with a supported expression for a subset of properties.

            This requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, `filter=lastUpdated gt "2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"` is encoded as `filter=lastUpdated%20gt%20%222013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z%22`. Filtering is case-sensitive for attribute names and query values, while attribute operators are case-insensitive.

            Filtering supports the following limited number of properties: `status`, `lastUpdated`, `id`, `profile.login`, `profile.email`, `profile.firstName`, and `profile.lastName`.

            Additionally, filtering supports only the equal `eq` operator from the standard Okta API filtering semantics, except in the case of the `lastUpdated` property. This property can also use the inequality operators (`gt`, `ge`, `lt`, and `le`). For logical operators, only the logical operators `and` and `or` are supported. The `not` operator isn't supported. See [Filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#filter) and [Operators](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#operators).
          schema:
            type: string

            filterByStatus:
              value: status eq "LOCKED_OUT"
              summary: Filter users with status of `LOCKED_OUT`
            filterByLogin:
              value: profile.login eq "login@example.com"
              summary: Filter users with a specified `login`

          in: query
          description: |-
            Searches for users with a supported filtering expression for most properties. Okta recommends using this parameter for search for best performance. This operation supports [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). Use an ID lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data.

            Property names in the search parameter are case sensitive, whereas operators (`eq`, `sw`, and so on) and string values are case insensitive. Unlike with user logins, diacritical marks are significant in search string values: a search for `isaac.brock` finds `Isaac.Brock`, but doesn't find a property whose value is `isáàc.bröck`. This operation requires [URL encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding). For example, `search=profile.department eq "Engineering"` is encoded as `search=profile.department%20eq%20%22Engineering%22`.

            > **Note:** If you use the special character `"` within a quoted string, it must also be escaped `\` and encoded. For example, `search=profile.lastName eq "bob"smith"` is encoded as `search=profile.lastName%20eq%20%22bob%5C%22smith%22`.

            This operation searches many properties:
              * Any user profile property, including custom-defined properties
              * The top-level properties `id`, `status`, `created`, `activated`, `statusChanged`, and `lastUpdated`
              * The [user type](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/user-types/) accessed as `type.id`

            You can also use `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters. The `ne` (not equal) operator isn't supported, but you can obtain the same result by using `lt ... or ... gt`. For example, to see all users except those that have a status of `STAGED`, use `(status lt "STAGED" or status gt "STAGED")`.

            You can search properties that are arrays. If any element matches the search term, the entire array (object) is returned. Okta follows the [SCIM Protocol Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2) for searching arrays. You can search multiple arrays, multiple values in an array, as well as using the standard logical and filtering operators. See [Filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter).

        > 
        > After a user is added to the Okta directory, they receive an activation email. As part of signing up for this service,

        All responses return the created user. Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation. The system performs group reconciliation during activation and assigns the user to all apps via direct or indirect relationships (group memberships).
        * The user's `transitioningToStatus` property is `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.
        * The user's `status` is `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.

        The user is emailed a one-time activation token if activated without a password.

        > **Note:** If the user is assigned to an app that is configured for provisioning, the activation process triggers downstream provisioning to the app.  It is possible for a user to sign in before these apps have been successfully provisioned for the user.

        > **Important:** Do not generate or send a one-time activation token when activating users with an assigned password. Users should sign in with their assigned password.

        For more information about the various scenarios of creating a user listed in the examples, see the [User creation scenarios](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#user-creation-scenarios) section.

      description: |-
        Retrieves a user from your Okta org.

        You can substitute `me` for the `id` to fetch the current user linked to an API token or session cookie.
         * The request returns the user linked to the API token that is specified in the Authorization header, not the user linked to the active session. Details of the admin user who granted the API token is returned.
         * When the end user has an active Okta session, it is typically a CORS request from the browser. Therefore, it's possible to retrieve the current user without the Authorization header.

        When fetching a user by `login` or `login shortname`, [URL encode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding) the request parameter to ensure that special characters are escaped properly. Logins with a `/` character can only be fetched by `id` due to URL issues with escaping the `/` character. If you don't know a user's ID, you can use the [List all users](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/listUsers) endpoint to find it.

        > **Note:** Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows. See [Mitigate the impact of third-party cookie deprecation](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-third-party-cookies).

        Deletes a user permanently. This operation can only be performed on users that have a `DEPROVISIONED` status. **This action can't be recovered!**

        This operation on a user that hasn't been deactivated causes that user to be deactivated. A second delete operation is required to delete the user.

        > **Note:** You can also perform user deletion asynchronously. To invoke asynchronous user deletion, pass an HTTP header `Prefer: respond-async` with the request.

        This header is also supported by user deactivation, which is performed if the delete endpoint is invoked on a user that hasn't been deactivated.

        This operation restarts the activation workflow if for some reason the user activation wasn't completed when using the `activationToken` from [Activate User](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserLifecycle/#tag/UserLifecycle/operation/activateUser).

        Users that don't have a password must complete the flow by completing [Reset Password](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserCred/#tag/UserCred/operation/resetPassword) and MFA enrollment steps to transition the user to `ACTIVE` status.

        If `sendEmail` is `false`, returns an activation link for the user to set up their account. The activation token can be used to create a custom activation link.

        Starts the forgot password flow.

        Generates a one-time token (OTT) that you can use to reset a User's Password.

        The User must validate their security question's answer when visiting the reset link. This operation can only be performed on Users with an ACTIVE status and
        a valid [Recovery Question credential](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#tag/User/operation/createUser!path=credentials/recovery_question&t=request).

        > **Note:** If you have migrated to Identity Engine, you can allow Users to recover passwords with any enrolled MFA authenticator. See [Self-service account recovery](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/authenticators/configure-sspr.htm?cshid=ext-config-sspr)

        If an email address is associated with multiple Users, keep in mind the following to ensure a successful password recovery lookup:
          * Okta no longer includes deactivated Users in the lookup.
          * The lookup searches sign-in IDs first, then primary email addresses, and then secondary email addresses.

        If `sendEmail` is `false`, returns a link for the User to reset their Password. This operation doesn't affect the status of the User.

      description: |-
        Enrolls a supported Factor for the specified user

        > **Note:** All responses return the enrolled Factor with a status of either `PENDING_ACTIVATION`` or `ACTIVE`.

        #### Additional SMS/Call Factor information
        * **Rate limits**: Okta may return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code if you attempt to resend an SMS or a voice call challenge (OTP) within the same time window. The current [rate limit](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/rate-limits/) is one SMS/CALL challenge per phone number every 30 seconds.
        * **Existing phone numbers**: Okta may return a `400 Bad Request` status code if a user attempts to enroll with a different phone number when the user has an existing mobile phone or has an existing phone with voice call capability. A user can enroll only one mobile phone for `sms` and enroll only one voice call capable phone for `call` factor.

        #### Additional WebAuthn Factor information
        **Enroll WebAuthn response parameters**
        * For detailed information on the Webauthn standard, including an up-to-date list of supported browsers, see [webauthn.me](https://a0.to/webauthnme-okta-docs).

        * In the enroll API response, the `response._embedded.activation` object contains properties used to help the client to create a new WebAuthn credential for use with Okta. See the [WebAuthn spec for PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/#dictionary-makecredentialoptions).

        #### Additional Custom TOTP Factor information

        **Enroll Custom TOTP Factor**
        * The enrollment process involves passing both the `factorProfileId` and `sharedSecret` properties for a token.

        * A Factor Profile represents a particular configuration of the Custom TOTP factor. It includes certain properties that match the hardware token that end users possess, such as the HMAC algorithm, passcode length, and time interval. There can be multiple Custom TOTP factor profiles per org, but users can only enroll in one Custom TOTP factor. Admins can [create Custom TOTP factor profiles](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext-mfa-totp) in the Admin Console. Then, copy the `factorProfileId` from the Admin Console into the API request.

        * <x-lifecycle class="oie"></x-lifecycle>
        For Custom TOTP enrollment, Okta automaticaly enrolls a user with a `token:software:totp` factor and the `push` factor if the user isn't currently enrolled with these factors.

      description: |-
        Resends an `sms`, `call`, or `email` factor challenge as part of an enrollment flow

        For `call` and `sms` factors, Okta enforces a rate limit of one OTP challenge per device every 30 seconds. You can configure your `sms` and `call` factors to use a third-party telephony provider. See the [Telephony inline hook reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/telephony-hook/). Okta round-robins between SMS providers with every resend request to help ensure delivery of an SMS and Call OTPs across different carriers.

        > **Note**: Resend operations aren't allowed after a factor exceeds the activation rate limit. See [Activate a Factor](./#tag/UserFactor/operation/activateFactor).

      description: |-
        Verifies an OTP for a Factor. Some Factors (`call`, `email`, `push`, `sms`, `u2f`, and `webauthn`) must first issue a challenge before you can verify the Factor. Do this by making a request without a body. After a challenge is issued, make another request to verify the Factor.

        **Note**: To verify a `push` factor, use the **poll** link returned when you issue the challenge. See [Retrieve a Factor Transaction Status](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserFactor/#tag/UserFactor/operation/getFactorTransactionStatus).

        * The User will have an `ACTIVE` status when the activation process completes.

        Users who don't have a password must complete the welcome flow by visiting the activation link to complete the transition to `ACTIVE` status.

        > **Note:** If you want to send a branded User Activation email, change the subdomain of your request to the custom domain that's associated with the brand.
        > For example, change `subdomain.okta.com` to `custom.domain.one`. See [Multibrand and custom domains](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/brands/#multibrand-and-custom-domains).

        > **Note:** If you have Optional Password enabled, visiting the activation link is optional for users who aren't required to enroll a password.

        **This action cannot be recovered!**

        Resets password. Generates a one-time token (OTT) that you can use to reset a User's password. You can automatically email the OTT link to the User or return the OTT to the API caller and distribute using a custom flow.

        This operation transitions the User to the `RECOVERY` status. The User is then not able to sign in or initiate a forgot password flow until they complete the reset flow.

        This operation provides an option to delete all the User's sessions. However, if the request is made in the context of a session owned by the specified User, that session isn't cleared.
        > **Note:** You can also use this API to convert a User with the Okta Credential Provider to use a Federated Provider. After this conversion, the User can't directly sign in with a password.
        > To convert a federated User back to an Okta User, use the default API call.

        If an email address is associated with multiple Users, keep in mind the following to ensure a successful password recovery lookup:
          * Okta no longer includes deactivated Users in the lookup.
          * The lookup searches sign-in IDs first, then primary email addresses, and then secondary email addresses.
          If `sendEmail` is `false`, returns a link for the User to reset their password.

      description: |-
        Assigns a [standard role](/openapi/okta-management/guides/roles/#standard-roles) to a Client Application.

        You can also assign a custom role to a Client Application, but the preferred method to assign a custom role to a client is to create a binding between the Custom Role, the Resource Set, and the Client Application. See [Create a Role Resource Set Binding](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/#tag/RoleDResourceSetBinding/operation/createResourceSetBinding).

        > **Notes:**
        > * The request payload is different for standard and custom role assignments.
        > * For IAM-based standard role assignments, use the request payload for standard roles. However, the response payload for IAM-based role assignments is similar to the custom role's assignment response.

        ### About

        The Okta telephony inline hook allows you to integrate your own custom code into Okta flows that send SMS or voice call messages. You can integrate this hook with enrollment, authentication, and recovery flows that involve the phone authenticator. Okta uses your external provider to deliver the one-time passcode (OTP) to the Requester. The provider can respond with commands that indicate if the delivery was successful or not.

        You can have only one active telephony inline hook per org.

        When you create a telephony inline hook, you must include the `authScheme` parameter. See [Create inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createInlineHook) and the [authScheme object](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createInlineHook!path=channel/0/config/authScheme&t=request)

        ### Time-out behavior

        If the provider response times out, Okta attempts to send the OTP using the Okta telephony providers. See [Troubleshoot](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createTelephonyInlineHook/#troubleshoot).

        >**Note:** The failover mechanism that uses the Okta telephony providers is heavily rate-limited.

        ### Troubleshoot

        This section explains several common causes of failure for telephony inline hooks.

        Note: Administrators can use the [Okta System Log](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/system-log/) to view errors. See the Troubleshooting section in the inline hooks topic for details on events captured by the Okta System Log.

      summary: Create a Password Import Inline Hook
      description: |-
        Creates a password import inline hook request, one type of inline hook supported by Okta. This is an automated request from Okta to your third-party service endpoint. This reference provides sample JSON objects that are contained in the outbound request from Okta to your external service,
        and sample JSON objects that you can include in your response. The objects that you return in the JSON payload of your response to this Okta request are an array of one or more objects,
        which specify the Okta commands to execute.

        >**Note:** The size of your response payload must be less than 256 KB.

        The password import inline hook allows you to migrate users from another data store where you want the users to retain their current passwords.
        Use this hook with the [Create user with password import inline hook flow](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook) that's described in the [Users API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/).

        The password import inline hook is triggered when the user tries to sign in to Okta for the first time. Okta sends your external service the password that the user supplied. Your external service then needs to send a response to Okta indicating whether the password supplied by the end user is valid.

        If your service returns a response that indicates that the password is valid, Okta sets the password for the user. The password import inline hook won't need to call your service again.
        However, if the Okta service is in read-only mode, it might not be possible to set the password. Okta then needs to call your service again the next time the user attempts to sign in.
        See [Password inline hook and Okta read-only mode](#password-inline-hook-and-okta-read-only-mode) and [Removing password from existing user store](#password-removal-from-an-existing-user-store).

        >**Notes:**
        > * Password policies don't apply to the password import inline hook. That is, if your external service validates the password, the password is imported even if it doesn't meet the Okta password policy requirements.
        > * You can create only one password import inline hook per org.

        ### Enable a password import inline hook

        To enable a password import inline hook, you first need to register your external service endpoint with Okta and configure it as an inline hook of type `com.okta.user.credential.password.import`.
        You can enable the hook using the Admin Console, see [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook) or through the [Inline Hooks management API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/).
        When creating a user with the Users API, you need to use the [Create User with password import inline hook](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/User/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook) use case.
        This involves specifying a `credentials.password.hook` property in the request body.

        When the user that you have added attempts to sign in to Okta for the first time, the hook is triggered and Okta calls your external service. The call sends the credentials that the end user provided. Your service can check
        the credentials and respond with a command to indicate whether the credentials are valid or not.

        ### Password inline hook and Okta read-only mode

        If your external service responds to Okta indicating that the credentials are valid, Okta saves the password and can authenticate the user independently from then on. However, if your Okta org is in a special [read-only mode](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/What-is-Oktas-Readonly-Mode)
        at the time the user signs in, then saving the password might not be possible. The next time the end user attempts to sign in, the password import inline hook needs to be called again.

        ### Password removal from an existing user store

        Because of the possibility of your org being in a special service mode, you shouldn't attempt to permanently delete user passwords from your existing user store until you can verify the success of the password import . An Okta System Log Event, `user.import.password`, is available for this purpose. An event of this type is created every time a password import inline hook is fired, with its `Event.Outcome` property providing a status of `FAILURE` or `SUCCESS` for the password import operation. 
        If the status is `SUCCESS`, Okta has successfully saved the end user's password, and it's safe to delete it from your previous user store.

        You can configure an [Event hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/) to send this event type to you for use when triggering automated cleanup of end-user
        passwords after successful migration.

        The Okta registration inline hook allows you to integrate your own custom code into Okta's [Profile Enrollment](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-create-profile-enrollment) flow. The hook is triggered after Okta receives the registration or profile update request. Your custom code can:
        - Allow or deny the registration attempt, based on your own validation of the information the user has submitted
        - Set or override the values that are populated in attributes of the user's Okta profile
        > **Note:** Profile Enrollment and self-service registration (SSR) inline hooks only work with the [Okta Sign-In Widget](https://developer.okta.com/code/javascript/okta_sign-in_widget/) version 4.5 or later.

        at the point immediately after any applicable profile attribute mappings have been applied, and any potential matches with existing users have been found, but before the Okta user profile is created.

        >**Note:** If the external service times out after receiving an Okta request, the Okta process flow continues and the user is created.

      summary: Create a SAML Assertion Inline Hook
      description: |-
        Creates a SAML Assertion inline hook request, one type of inline hook supported by Okta. This is an automated request from Okta to your third-party service endpoint. This reference provides sample JSON objects that are contained in the outbound request from Okta to your external service, and sample JSON objects that you can include in your response. The objects that you return in the JSON payload of your response to this Okta request are an array of one or more objects, which specify the Okta commands to execute.

        This type of inline hook is triggered when Okta generates a SAML assertion in response to an authentication request. Before sending the SAML assertion to the app that will consume it, Okta calls out to your external service. Your external service can respond with commands to add attributes to the assertion or to modify its existing attributes.

        You can use this functionality to add data to assertions, which might be data that is sensitive, calculated at runtime, or complexly-structured and not appropriate for storing in Okta user profiles. Data added this way is never logged or stored by Okta. As an example, SAML assertions generated for a medical app could be augmented with confidential patient data provided by your external service and not stored in Okta.

        This inline hook works only when using custom SAML apps, not apps from the OIN.

        See also:
          * [Inline hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/) for a general introduction to Okta inline hooks
          * [Inline Hooks Management API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/) for information on the API for registering external service endpoints with Okta

          * For steps to enable this inline hook, see [Add an inline hook](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-add-inline-hook).

        ### Specify location within the assertion

        Specify the location within the assertion where you want to apply your operation using a slash-delimited path, which follows JSON Patch conventions.

        When you perform an `add` op to add a new attribute statement, begin with `/claims/` and follow that with the name of the new attribute that you're adding.

        When you modify an existing assertions statement, begin the path with `/subject/`, `/authentication/`, `/conditions/`, or `/claims/`, depending on which part of the assertion you want to modify. You then look deeper within the child elements using slash-delimited element names, for example, `/claims/array/attributeValues/1/value`. (The `/1/` in the path indicates the index of the array, using zero-based indexing.)

        ### URI claims

        Okta supports URI claims with SAML assertion hooks. When you need to replace or add a URI claim, encode the claim name within the command per the [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) specification. Specifically, this replaces `~` with `~0` and `/` with `~1`.

        ### SessionNotOnOrAfter support

        In some scenarios, your service provider may require the `SessionNotOnOrAfter` attribute for the `<saml:AuthnStatement>` in the SAML assertion, which sets the provider session time correctly. Use `add` op with the path `/authentication/sessionLifetime` and a value for session lifetime in seconds to add this attribute. Okta calculates `SessionNotOnOrAfter` by adding the `/authentication/sessionLifetime` value to the `issueInstant` attribute and returns it in the SAML `data.assertion.

      summary: Create a Token inline hook
      description: |-
        Creates a Token inline hook request, one type of inline hook supported by Okta. This is an automated request from Okta to your third-party service endpoint. This reference provides sample JSON objects that are contained in the outbound request from Okta to your external service, and sample JSON objects that you can include in your response.

        This type of inline hook is triggered when OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) tokens are minted by your Okta custom authorization server. Before sending the token to the requester, Okta calls out to your external service. Your service can then respond with commands to add custom claims to the token or to modify existing claims.

        Use this functionality to add data that is sensitive, calculated at runtime, or complexly structured and not appropriate for storing in Okta user profiles. Okta never logs nor stores data that is added this way. As an example, tokens minted for a medical app could be augmented with confidential patient data provided by your external service and not stored in Okta.

        In addition to adding custom claims, you can modify or remove an existing custom claim or an OIDC standard profile claim. You can also update how long an access token or an ID token is valid.

        This inline hook works only when using an [Okta custom authorization server](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/customize-authz-server/main/#create-an-authorization-server), not the built-in Okta org authorization server.

        See also:
          * [Inline hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/) for a general introduction to Okta inline hooks
          * [Inline Hooks Management API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/) for information on the API for registering external service endpoints with Okta
          * For an example implementation of this inline hook, see [Token inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/token-inline-hook)

        ### Timeout behavior
        After receiving the Okta request, if there's a response timeout, the Okta process flow proceeds with the original token returned.

        ### Enabling a token inline hook
        To activate the inline hook, you first need to register your external service endpoint with Okta using the [Inline Hooks Management API](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook).
        You then need to associate the registered inline hook with a custom authorization server policy rule by completing the following steps:
        1. Go to **Security** > **API** > **Authorization Servers.**
        2. Select a custom authorization server from the list.
        3. Select **Access Policies** and select a policy to use with the hook. In most cases, pick the Default Policy.
        4. One of the policy's rules needs to trigger the inline hook. Click the pencil icon for a rule to edit it. If you only have one rule, edit the Default Policy Rule.
        5. Click the **Use this Inline Hook** dropdown menu. Any inline hooks that you have registered are listed. Select the hook that you would like to use.
        6. Click **Update Rule**.

        > **Note:** You can associate only one inline hook with each rule.

        ### Troubleshoot
        This section covers what happens when a token inline hook flow fails either due to the external inline hook service returning an error object or not returning a successful response, or the inline hook patch fails.
        > **Note:** Administrators can use the [Okta System Log](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/system-log/) to view errors. See the [Troubleshooting](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/#troubleshooting) section in the inline hooks concept piece for more information on the events related to inline hooks that the Okta System Log captures.
        - When there's a communication failure with the external service, a timeout for example, the inline hook operation is skipped. The token is generated without any modification from the inline hook.
          
          **Who can see this error?** Administrators

        - When the external service returns a response with any other HTTP status code besides `200`, the inline hook operation is skipped. The token is generated without any modification from the inline hook.
          
          **Who can see this error?** Administrators

        - When the external service returns an error object in the response, the entire token inline hook flow fails with no token generated.
          
          **Who can see this error?** Administrators, developers, and end users. When the OAuth 2.0 client receives the error, the client developer can see that error if the client has the debug information. What the end user sees depends on how errors are handled within the client.
          > **Note:** See the [error](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/token-hook/#error) section on this page for more information on what to include in the error object of your response and what the OAuth 2.0 error includes that Okta returns to the requestor of the token.

        - When a hook command (for example, updating, adding, and deleting claims) can't be performed, the inline hook operation is skipped. The token is generated without any modification from the inline hook.
          
          **Who can see this error?** Administrators

          The following actions result in an error:
            - Using an invalid command. For example, if only an ID token is requested, the `commands` array shouldn't contain commands of the type `com.okta.access.patch`.
            - Using an invalid operation
            - Attempting to remove a system-specific claim
            - Attempting to update a claim that doesn't exist
            - Attempting to update an element within an array that doesn't exist or specifying an invalid index
            - Attempting to remove a claim that doesn't exist

        Specifies the media type of the resource. Optional `okta-response` value can be included for performance optimization.

        Complex DelAuth configurations may degrade performance when fetching specific parts of the response, and passing this parameter can omit these parts, bypassing the bottleneck.

        Enum values for `okta-response`:
          * `omitCredentials`: Omits the credentials subobject from the response.
          * `omitCredentialsLinks`: Omits the following HAL links from the response: Change Password, Change Recovery Question, Forgot Password, Reset Password, Reset Factors, Unlock.
          * `omitTransitioningToStatus`: Omits the `transitioningToStatus` field from the response.

Existing default authenticator enrollment policies from a migrated Classic Engine org remain unchanged. The policies still use the `factors` property in their settings. The `authenticators` parameter allows you to configure all available authenticators, including authentication and recovery.

            Indicates which value is specified in the issuer of the tokens that a custom authorization server returns: the Okta org domain URL or a custom domain URL.

            `issuerMode` is visible if you have a custom URL domain configured or the Dynamic Issuer Mode feature enabled. If you have a custom URL domain configured, you can set a custom domain URL in a custom authorization server, and this property is returned in the appropriate responses.

            When set to `ORG_URL`, then in responses, `issuer` is the Okta org domain URL: `https://${yourOktaDomain}`.

            When set to `CUSTOM_URL`, then in responses, `issuer` is the custom domain URL configured in the administration user interface.

            When set to `DYNAMIC`, then in responses, `issuer` is the custom domain URL if the OAuth 2.0 request was sent to the custom domain, or is the Okta org's domain URL if the OAuth 2.0 request was sent to the original Okta org domain.

            After you configure a custom URL domain, all new custom authorization servers use `CUSTOM_URL` by default. If the Dynamic Issuer Mode feature is enabled, then all new custom authorization servers use `DYNAMIC` by default. All existing custom authorization servers continue to use the original value until they're changed using the Admin Console or the API. This way, existing integrations with the client and resource server continue to work after the feature is enabled.

Each requirement must correspond to a different major version (Windows 11 or Windows 10). If a requirement isn't specified for a major version, then devices on that major version satisfy the condition.

                There are two types of OS requirements:
                * **Static**: A specific Windows version requirement that doesn't change until you update the policy. A static OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `minimum`.
                * **Dynamic**: A Windows version requirement that is relative to the latest major release and security patch. A dynamic OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `dynamicVersionRequirement`.

                > **Note:** Dynamic OS requirements are available only if the **Dynamic OS version compliance** [self-service EA](/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature is enabled. The `osVersionConstraints` property is only supported for the Windows platform. You can't specify both `osVersion.minimum` and `osVersionConstraints` properties at the same time.

      description: |-
        Specifies required and optional properties for a Group. The `objectClass` of a Group determines which additional properties are available.

        You can extend Group Profiles with custom properties, but you must first add the properties to the Group Profile schema before you can reference them. Use the Profile Editor in the Admin Console or the [Schemas API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/)to manage schema extensions.

        Custom properties can contain HTML tags. It is the client's responsibility to escape or encode this data before displaying it. Use [best-practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html) to prevent cross-site scripting.

            Non-empty array of valid JSON schemas.

            Okta only supports `oneOf` for specifying display names for an `enum`. Each schema has the following format:

              ```
                {
                  "const": "enumValue",
                  "title": "display name"
                }
              ```json

            When `enum` is used in conjunction with `oneOf`, you must keep the set of enumerated values and their order.

              ```
                {"enum": ["S","M","L","XL"],
                  "oneOf": [
                    {"const": "S", "title": "Small"},
                    {"const": "M", "title": "Medium"},
                    {"const": "L", "title": "Large"},
                    {"const": "XL", "title": "Extra Large"}
                  ]
                }
              ```json

            The `oneOf` key is only supported in conjunction with `enum` and provides a mechanism to return a display name for the `enum` value.

        The Identity Provider object's `type` property identifies the social or enterprise Identity Provider used for authentication. 
        Each Identity Provider uses a specific protocol, therefore the `protocol` property must correspond with the IdP `type`. 
        If the protocol is OAuth 2.0-based, the Protocol object's `scopes` property must also correspond with the scopes supported by the IdP `type`. 
        For policy actions supported by each IdP type, see [IdP type policy actions](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/IdentityProvider/#tag/IdentityProvider/operation/createIdentityProvider!path=policy&t=request).

    LogAuthenticationContext:
      description: |-
        All authentication relies on validating one or more credentials that prove the authenticity of the actor's identity. Credentials are sometimes provided by the actor, as is the case with passwords, and at other times provided by a third party, and validated by the authentication provider.

        The authenticationContext contains metadata about how the actor is authenticated. For example, an authenticationContext for an event, where a user authenticates with Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA), looks like the following:
        ```
        {
            "authenticationProvider": "ACTIVE_DIRECTORY",
            "authenticationStep": 0,
            "credentialProvider": null,
            "credentialType": "IWA",
            "externalSessionId": "102N1EKyPFERROGvK9wizMAPQ",
            "interface": null,
            "issuer": null
        }
        ```
        In this case, the user enters an IWA credential to authenticate against an Active Directory instance. All of the user's future-generated events in this sign-in session are going to share the same `externalSessionId`.

        Among other operations, this response object can be used to scan for suspicious sign-in activity or perform analytics on user authentication habits (for example, how often authentication scheme X is used versus authentication scheme Y).

    LogDebugContext:
      description: |-
        For some kinds of events (for example, OLM provisioning, sign-in request, second factor SMS, and so on), the fields that are provided in other response objects aren't sufficient to adequately describe the operations that the event has performed. In such cases, the `debugContext` object provides a way to store additional information.

        For example, an event where a second factor SMS token is sent to a user may have a `debugContext` that looks like the following:
        ```
        {
            "debugData": {
                "requestUri": "/api/v1/users/00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV/factors/smsf8luacpZJAva10x45/verify",
                "smsProvider": "TELESIGN",
                "transactionId": "268632458E3C100F5F5F594C6DC689D4"
            }
        }
        ```
        By inspecting the debugData field, you can find the URI that is used to trigger the second factor SMS (`/api/v1/users/00u3gjksoiRGRAZHLSYV/factors/smsf8luacpZJAva10x45/verify`), the SMS provider (`TELESIGN`), and the ID used by Telesign to identify this transaction (`268632458E3C100F5F5F594C6DC689D4`).

        If for some reason the information that is needed to implement a feature isn't provided in other response objects, you should scan the `debugContext.debugData` field for potentially useful fields.
        > **Important:** The information contained in `debugContext.debugData` is intended to add context when troubleshooting customer platform issues. Both key names and values may change from release to release and aren't guaranteed to be stable. Therefore, they shouldn't be viewed as a data contract but as a debugging aid instead.

    LogTransaction:
      description: |-
        A `transaction` object comprises contextual information associated with its respective event. 
        This information is useful for understanding sequences of correlated events.
        For example, a `transaction` object such as the following:
        ```
        {
          "id": "Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo",
          "type": "WEB",
          "detail": null
        }
        ```
        indicates that a `WEB` request with `id` `Wn4f-0RQ8D8lTSLkAmkKdQAADqo` has created this event.

        A `transaction` object with a `requestApiTokenId` in the `detail` object, for example :
        ```
        {
          "id": "YjSlblAAqnKY7CdyCkXNBgAAAIU",
          "type": "WEB",
          "detail": {
            "requestApiTokenId": "00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5"
          }
        }
        ```
        indicates that this event was the result of an action performed through an API using the token identified by 00T94e3cn9kSEO3c51s5. The token ID is visible in the Admin Console, **Security** > **API**. See [API token management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=Security_API). For more information on API tokens, see [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/).

        In the Okta event data object, the `UserAgent` object provides specifications about the client software that makes event-triggering HTTP requests. User agent identification is often useful for identifying interoperability problems between servers and clients, and also for browser and operating system usage analytics.

        > **Notes:**
        > * If you request a scope that requires consent while using the `client_credentials` flow, an error is returned because the flow doesn't support user consent.
        > * If the `prompt` value is set to `NONE`, but the `consent_method` and the consent values are set to `REQUIRED`, then an error occurs.
        > * When a scope is requested during a Client Credentials grant flow and `consent` is set to `FLEXIBLE`, the scope is granted in the access token with no consent prompt. This occurs because there is no user involved in a two-legged OAuth 2.0 [Client Credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/) grant flow.

              Any configured redirect URIs may contain a single `*` character in the lowest-level domain (for example, `https://redirect-*-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect`) to act as a wildcard.
              The wildcard subdomain must have at least one subdomain between it and the top level domain.
              The wildcard can match any valid hostname characters, but can't span more than one domain.
              For example, if `https://redirect-*-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect` is configured as a redirect URI, then `https://redirect-1-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect` and `https://redirect-sub-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect` match, but `https://redirect-1.sub-domain.example.com/oidc/redirect` doesn't match.
              Only the `https` URI scheme can use wildcard redirect URIs.
              > **Note:** The use of wildcard subdomains is discouraged as an insecure practice, since it may allow malicious actors to have tokens or authorization codes sent to unexpected or attacker-controlled pages. Exercise caution if you decide to include a wildcard redirect URI in your configuration.

        When a user has a valid password, imported hashed password, or password hook, and a response object contains
        a password credential, then the password object is a bare object without the value property defined (for example, `password: {}`). This indicates that a password value exists. You can modify password policy requirements in the Admin Console by editing the Password authenticator:  **Security** > **Authenticators** > **Password** (or for Okta Classic orgs, use **Security** > **Authentication** > **Password**).

        For information on defaults and configuring your password policies, see [Configure the password authenticator](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-configure-password) in the help documentation.

    PasswordCredentialHash:
      description: |-
        Specifies a hashed password to import into Okta. This allows an existing password to be imported into Okta directly
        from some other store. Okta supports the BCRYPT, SHA-512, SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5, and PBKDF2 hash functions for password import.
         A hashed password may be specified in a password object when creating or updating a user, but not for other operations.
         See the **Create user with imported hashed password** section in the [Users API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-imported-hashed-password) description. When updating a user with a hashed password, the usermust be in the `STAGED` status.

            This is the Base64-encoded `value` of the SHA-512/SHA-256/SHA-1/MD5/PBKDF2 digest that was computed by either pre-fixing or post-fixing
            the `salt` to the `password`, depending on the `saltOrder`. If a `salt` was not used in the `source` system, then this should just be
            the Base64-encoded `value` of the password's SHA-512/SHA-256/SHA-1/MD5/PBKDF2 digest. For BCRYPT, this is the actual Radix-64 encoded hashed password.

            * As a best security practice, you should define a regular expression pattern to filter untrusted IdP usernames. This is especially important if multiple IdPs are connected to your org. The filter prevents an IdP from issuing an assertion for any User, including partners or directory Users in your Okta org.
            * For example, the filter pattern `(\S+@example\.com)` allows only Users that have an `@example.com` username suffix. It rejects assertions that have any other suffix such as `@corp.example.com` or `@partner.com`.
            * Only `SAML2` and `OIDC` IdP providers support the `filter` property.

        * IdP User profile attributes can be referenced with the `idpuser` prefix such as `idpuser.subjectNameId`.
        * You must define an IdP User profile attribute before it can be referenced in an Okta EL expression. To define an IdP User attribute policy, you may need to create a new IdP instance without a base profile property. Then edit the IdP User profile to update the IdP instance with an expression that references the IdP User profile attribute that you just created.

        commands:
          description: |-
            The `commands` object lets you invoke commands to modify or add values to the attributes in the Okta user profile that are created for this user. The object also lets you control whether or not the registration attempt is allowed to proceed.

            This object is an array, allowing you to send multiple commands in your response. Each array element requires a `type` property and a `value` property. The `type` property is where you specify which of the supported commands you wish to execute, and `value` is where you supply parameters for that command.

            The registration inline hook supports these three commands:
            * `com.okta.user.profile.update`: Change attribute values in the user's Okta user profile. For SSR only. Invalid if used with a Progressive Profile response.
            * `com.okta.action.update`: Allow or deny the user's registration.
            * `com.okta.user.progressive.profile.update`: Change attribute values in the user's Okta Progressive Profile.

              type:
                description: |-
                  The location where you specify the command. To set attributes in the user's Okta profile, supply a `type` property set to `com.okta.user.profile.update`, together with a `value` property set to a list of key-value pairs corresponding to the Okta user profile attributes you want to set. The attributes must already exist in your user profile schema.

                  To explicitly allow or deny registration to the user, supply a type property set to `com.okta.action.update`, together with a value property set to `{"registration": "ALLOW"}` or `{"registration": "DENY"}`. The default is to allow registration.

                  In Okta Identity Engine, to set attributes in the user's profile, supply a `type` property set to `com.okta.user.progressive.profile.update`, together with a `value` property set to a list of key-value pairs corresponding to the Progressive Enrollment attributes that you want to set. See [Registration inline hook - Send response](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/registration-inline-hook/nodejs/main/#send-response).

                  Commands are applied in the order that they appear in the array. Within a single `com.okta.user.profile.update` or `com.okta.user.progressive.profile.update command`, attributes are updated in the order that they appear in the `value` object.

                  You can never use a command to update the user's password, but you are allowed to set the values of attributes other than password that are designated sensitive in your Okta user schema. However, the values of those sensitive attributes, if included as fields in the Profile Enrollment form, aren't included in the `data.userProfile` object sent to your external service by Okta. See [data.userProfile](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/create-registration-hook!path=0/data/userProfile&t=request).

              value:
                additionalProperties: true
                description: |-
                  The `value` object is the parameter to pass to the command.

                  For `com.okta.user.profile.update` commands, `value` should be an object containing one or more name-value pairs for the attributes you wish to update.

                  For `com.okta.action.update` commands, the value should be an object containing the attribute `action` set to a value of either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, indicating whether the registration should be permitted or not.

                  Registrations are allowed by default, so setting a value of `ALLOW` for the action field is valid but superfluous.

        Error:
          description: |-
            For the registration inline hook, the `error` object provides a way of displaying an error message to the end user who is trying to register or update their profile.

            * If you're using the Okta Sign-In Widget for Profile Enrollment, only the `errorSummary` messages of the `errorCauses` objects that your external service returns appear as inline errors, given the following:
              * You don't customize the error handling behavior of the widget.
              * The `location` of `errorSummary` in the `errorCauses` object specifies the request object's user profile attribute.
            * If you don't return a value for the `errorCauses` object, and deny the user's registration attempt through the `commands` object in your response to Okta, one of the following generic messages appears to the end user:
              * "Registration cannot be completed at this time." (SSR)
              * "We found some errors. Please review the form and make corrections." (Progressive Enrollment)
            * If you don't return an `error` object at all and the registration is denied, the following generic message appears to the end user:
              * "Registration denied." (SSR)
              * "Profile update denied." (Progressive Enrollment)

            >**Note:** If you include an error object in your response, no commands are executed and the registration fails. This holds true even if the top-level `errorSummary` and the `errorCauses` objects are omitted.

          `okta_post_message` is an adaptation of the [Web Message Response Mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sakimura-oauth-wmrm-00#section-4.1).
          This value provides a secure way for a single-page application to perform a sign-in flow in a pop-up window or an iFrame and receive the ID token, access token, and/or authorization code back in the parent page without leaving the context of that page. The data object for the `postMessage` call is in the next section.

            `commands` is an array, allowing you to send multiple commands. In each array element, include a `type` property and a `value` property. The `type` property is where you specify which of the supported commands you want to execute, and `value` is where you supply an operand for that command.
            In the case of the SAML assertion inline hook, the `value` property is itself a nested object, in which you specify a particular operation, a path to act on, and a value.

            You can use the `commands` object to provide commands to Okta. It's where you can tell Okta to add more claims to the token.
            The `commands` object is an array, allowing you to send multiple commands. In each array element, there needs to be a `type` property and `value` property. The `type` property is where you specify which of the supported commands you want to execute, and `value` is where you supply an operand for that command.
            In the case of the token hook type, the `value` property is itself a nested object in which you specify a particular operation, a path to act on, and a value.

                          You can modify (`replace`) existing custom claims or OIDC standard profile claims, such as `birthdate` and `locale`. You can't, however, modify any system-specific claims, such as `iss` or `ver`. Also, you can't modify a claim that isn't currently part of the token in the request payload. Attempting to modify a system-specific claim or using an invalid operation results in the entire PATCH failing and errors logged in the token hooks events.

                          Use the `replace` operation to modify members within JSON objects and elements within arrays. For example, you have a JSON object in a claim called `employee_profile`, and you want to update the email address of the employee. The existing target JSON object is updated by specifying the claim in the path, followed by the name of the object member that you want to modify.

                        <summary>Remove members from existing JSON objects</summary>

                         Use the `remove` operation to remove members from existing JSON objects. Do this by specifying the JSON object in the path, followed by the claim member that you would like to remove. For example, you have an `employee_profile` claim, and you want to remove `email` from it.

                        **Existing target JSON object**

                        ```

                            }
                        }
                        ```

            Sends an asynchronous push notification to the device for approval by the user. You must poll the transaction to determine the state of the activation. See [Retrieve a Factor transaction status](./#tag/UserFactor/operation/getFactorTransactionStatus).

            No request body is required for `push` Factors.

            Activations have a short lifetime of several minutes and return a `TIMEOUT` if not completed before the timestamp specified in the `expiresAt` param. Use the published activate link to restart the activation process if the activation expires.

You can use the Profile Editor in the Admin Console or the [Schemas API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UISchema/#tag/UISchema) to make schema modifications.

        You can extend user profiles with custom properties. You must first add the custom property to the user profile schema before you reference it.

            The unique identifier for the user (`username`). For validation, see [Login pattern validation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/schemas/#login-pattern-validation).

            Every user within your Okta org must have a unique identifier for a login. This constraint applies to all users you import from other systems or applications such as Active Directory. Your organization is the top-level namespace to mix and match logins from all your connected applications or directories. Careful consideration of naming conventions for your login identifier will make it easier to onboard new applications in the future.

            Logins are not considered unique if they differ only in case and/or diacritical marks. If one of your users has a login of Isaac.Brock@example.com, there cannot be another user whose login is isaac.brock@example.com, nor isáàc.bröck@example.com.

            Okta has a default ambiguous name resolution policy for usernames that include @-signs. (By default, usernames must be formatted as email addresses and thus always include @-signs. You can remove that restriction using either the Admin Console or the Schemas API (opens new window).) Users can sign in with their non-qualified short name (for example: isaac.brock with username isaac.brock@example.com) as long as the short name is still unique within the organization.

            User Profile subschemas

            The Profile object for a User is defined by a composite Schema of base and custom properties using a JSON path to reference subschemas. The `#base` properties are defined and versioned by Okta, while `#custom` properties are extensible. Custom property names for the Profile object must be unique and can't conflict with a property name defined in the `#base` subschema.

            Non-empty array of valid JSON schemas.

            Okta only supports `oneOf` for specifying display names for an `enum`. Each schema has the following format:

              ```
                {
                  "const": "enumValue",
                  "title": "display name"
                }
              ```json

            When `enum` is used in conjunction with `oneOf`, you must keep the set of enumerated values and their order.

              ```
                {"enum": ["S","M","L","XL"],
                  "oneOf": [
                    {"const": "S", "title": "Small"},
                    {"const": "M", "title": "Medium"},
                    {"const": "L", "title": "Large"},
                    {"const": "XL", "title": "Extra Large"}
                  ]
                }
              ```json

            The `oneOf` key is only supported in conjunction with `enum` and provides a mechanism to return a display name for the `enum` value.

            Unique identifier for the User (`username`)

            The login property is validated according to its pattern attribute, which is a string. By default, the attribute is null. When the attribute is null, the username is required to be formatted as an email address as defined by [RFC 6531 Section 3.3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531#section-3.3). The pattern can be set through the API to one of the following forms. (The Admin Console provides access to the same forms.)
              * A login pattern of `".+"` indicates that there is no restriction on usernames. Any non-empty, unique value is permitted, and the minimum length of five isn't enforced. In this case, usernames don't need to include the `@` character. If a name does include `@`, the portion ahead of the `@` can be used for logging in, provided it identifies a unique User within the org.
              * A login pattern of the form `"[...]+"` indicates that usernames must only contain characters from the set given between the brackets. The enclosing brackets and final `+` are required for this form. Character ranges can be indicated using hyphens. To include the hyphen itself in the allowed set, the hyphen must appear first. Any characters in the set except the hyphen, a-z, A-Z, and 0-9 must be preceded by a backslash (`\`). For example, `"[a-z13579\.]+"` would restrict usernames to lowercase letters, odd digits, and periods, while `"[-a-zA-Z0-9]+"` would allow basic alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

Instead, Okta evaluates password policy at login time, notices the password has expired, and moves the user to the expired state. When running reports, remember that the data is valid as of the last login or lifecycle event for that user.
