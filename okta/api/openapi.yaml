    As an option to increase org security, Okta supports CAPTCHA services to prevent automated sign-in attempts. You can integrate one of two providers: [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) or [reCAPTCHA v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible).

    The vendor implementations supported by Okta are both invisible. They each run risk-analysis software in the background during user sign in to determine the likelihood that the user is a bot. This risk analysis is based on the settings that you configure with the provider that you choose.

    Before you configure your org to use CAPTCHA, sign in to the vendor of your choice or sign up for an account. For more details, refer to [CAPTCHA integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=csh-captcha).

    These endpoints allow you to programmatically manage email customizations.

    Okta provides many customizable email templates. For example, the `UserActivation` email template allows users to activate their account. Use email customizations to override a template's default content. See the [list of email templates](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#use-customizable-email-templates).

    Each template has default content that Okta translates to any one of the supported languages. The following settings determine the language for emails sent from Okta to a user, if the user hasn't selected a specific display language:
    * The user's locale property value (if specified)
    * The org's display language

    See [Supported languages](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-email/main/#supported-languages).

    The following constraints apply to email customizations:
    * If an email template has any customizations at all, exactly one of them must be the default (where `isDefault` is `true`). Okta uses the default customization when no other customization applies to the user's language settings.
    * Each email template can have only one customization for each supported language.

    ### Enable other locales
    <ApiLifecycle access="ea" />

    Use the [BCP 47 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) to enable more locales than Okta's 27 default languages.

    Once you create a customization with the new locale, the locale appears in the Admin Console along with the default-supported locales.

    Include `null` in the subject or body of the email customization. Okta replaces `null` with a default value based on the following order of priority:

    - An existing default email customization, if one exists
    - Okta-provided translated content for the specified language, if one exists
    - Okta-provided translated content for the brand locale, if it's set
    - Okta-provided content in English

    Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the Linked Objects API to represent the relationship.

    1. Create a Linked Object definition such as Manager:Subordinate or Case Worker:Client. These pairs are represented by a `primary` attribute and an `associated` attribute.
    2. Link users together to create the relationship between the two. You create a Linked Object value with a single request that links one `primary` and one `associated` user.

    For each relationship:

    * A user has at most one `primary` link (a user has a single manager), but can have many `associated` links (a user can have many subordinates).
    * A user can be the `primary` in one relationship and the `associated` in another.
    * A user can be both the `primary` and `associated` in the same relationship.

    Okta Expression Language function for [Linked Objects](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#linked-object-function) provides access to the details about a linked user.

    > **Note:** The Linked Objects feature isn't available for OpenID Connect claims.

    ## Example usage

    Okta allows you to create up to 200 Linked Object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many, for example:

    * A manager has many subordinates. Each subordinate has one manager.
    * A sales representative has many customers. Each customer has one sales rep.
    * A case worker has many clients. Each client has one case worker.

    Most organizations have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the Linked Object definition once, and then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

    You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per Linked Object definition. But a user can be assigned to more than one Linked Object definition.

    For example, assume that you've created one Linked Object definition for manager (`primary`) and for subordinates (`associated`):

    * Joe is Frank's manager.
    * Bob is Joe's manager, but Jane's subordinate.
    * Jane is the CEO, so she reports to herself.

    Thus, you can create chains of relationships (Jane > Bob > Joe > Frank) or terminal relationships (Jane is both `primary` and `associated` user).

    Then, if you create another Linked Object relationship for scrum team membership, you could assign relationships to the same four users:

    * Bob is the scrum lead for the Identity Scrum team.
    * Joe and Frank are both contributors to the team.

    Bob can be the `primary` for a Manager:Subordinate, an `associated` user for that same Linked Object definition, and also the `primary` for the Scrumlead:Contributor Linked Object definition.

    To represent a relationship, create a Linked Object definition that specifies a `primary` (parent) relationship and an `associated` (child) relationship, and then add a link in which the appropriate user is assigned to each side of that link type.

    ## Links between User Types

    If you created multiple User Types (see [User Types](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/UserType/)), they all share the same Linked Object definitions. For example, if you have separate User Types for employees and contractors, a link could designate an employee as the manager for a contractor, with the contractor being a subordinate of that employee.

    ## Link definition operations

    Link definition operations allow you to manage the creation and removal of the link definitions. If you remove a link definition, links based on that definition are unavailable.

    > **Note:** Links reappear if you recreate the definition. However, Okta is likely to change this behavior so that links don't reappear. Don't rely on this behavior in production environments.

    The Network Zones API provides operations to manage system default and custom zones in your Okta org.
    Network Zones are configurable boundaries that you can use to grant or restrict access to resources in your organization.
    They're used for two purposes:
    * `POLICY`: Network Zones used to guide policy decisions
    * `BLOCKLIST`: Network Zones used to deny access from certain IP addresses, locations, Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs), proxy types, or IP service categories before policy evaluation
    > **Note:** The Network Zone blocklist applies to all URLs for the org.

    See [Network zones](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Security_Network) in the Okta product documentation.

    Your Okta org provides the following default system Network Zones that you can modify and use:
    * `LegacyIpZone`: The system default IP Network Zone
    * `BlockedIpZone`: The system default IP Blocklist Network Zone
    * <x-lifecycle class="ea"></x-lifecycle> `DefaultEnhancedDynamicZone`: The system default Enhanced Dynamic Network Zone

    You can create and use the following custom Network Zones:
    * IP Network Zone (`IP`): Allows you to define network perimeters around a set of IPs
    * Dynamic Network Zone (`DYNAMIC`): Allows you to define network perimeters around location, IP type, or ASNs
    * <x-lifecycle class="ea"></x-lifecycle> Enhanced Dynamic Network Zone (`DYNAMIC_V2`): Extends the Dynamic Network Zone and allows you to include or exclude specific locations, ASNs, or IP service categories

    > **Notes:**

    The Okta Push Providers API provides a centralized integration platform to fetch and manage push provider configurations. Okta administrators can use these APIs to provide their push provider credentials, for example from APNs and FCM, so that Okta can send push notifications to their own custom app authenticator applications.

    The Push Providers API supports the following **Authorization Schemes**:
    * SSWS - [API tokens](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#authentication)
    * Bearer - [OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/)

    > **Notes:**
    > * Some of the curl code examples on this page include SSWS API token authentication. However, Okta recommends using scoped OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens to authenticate with Okta management APIs. OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens provide fine-grain control over the bearer's actions on specific endpoints. See [Okta API authentication methods](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#authentication).
    > * You can use the Push Providers API as part of the "Create a custom authenticator" flow. See the [Custom authenticator integration guide](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/authenticators-custom-authenticator/android/main/).

    Role targets are a way of defining permissions for admin roles into a smaller subset of Groups or Apps within your org. Targets limit an admin's permissions to a targeted area of the org. You can define admin roles to target Groups, Applications, and Application Instances.

    * **Group targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage only a specified Group. For example, an admin role may be assigned to manage only the IT Group.
    * **App targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage all instances of the specified Apps. Target Apps are Okta catalog Apps. For example, you can have multiple configurations of an Okta catalog App, such as Salesforce or Facebook. When you add a Salesforce or Facebook App as a target, that grants the admin permission to manage all the instances of those Apps and create new instances of them.
    * **App Instance targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage an instance of one App or instances of multiple Apps. App Instances are specific Apps that admins have created in their org. For example, there may be a Salesforce App configured differently for each sales region of a company. When you create an App Instance target, you can assign an admin to manage only two instances of the configured Salesforce Apps and then also to manage an instance of another configured App such as Workday.

    > **Note:** Don't use these operations with a Custom Role ID. Custom Role assignments always require a target Resource Set. See [Role Assignments](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/role-assignment/) for more information.

    > This feature is only available as a part of Okta Identity Engine. Your Okta org must have the SSF Receiver API feature enabled.
    > Contact your Okta account team to enable this feature.

    Okta uses the [Shared Signals Framework (SSF)](https://sharedsignals.guide/) to receive security-related events and other data-subject signals from third-party security vendors. In this scenario, commonly used terms for third-party vendors that send signals are "transmitters", Okta is the "receiver", and the connection between the two entities is referred to as a "stream."

    The SSF Receiver API allows you to manage SSF vendor stream configurations between the transmitter and Okta. A stream is configured by [creating a Security Events Provider](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/#tag/SSFReceiver/operation/createSecurityEventsProviderInstance) object in your Okta org. You can create a Security Events Provider object in Okta with a published well-known URL or an issuer-and-JWKS combination.

    After the Security Events Provider object is created for a transmitter, the provider can use the [SSF Security Event Tokens](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFSecurityEventToken/) API to publish events to Okta. While the SSF allows ingestion through push and poll-based operations, Okta currently supports only push-based operations.

    > Contact your Okta account team to enable this feature.

    The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) Security Event Tokens API allows third-party security event providers to send Security Event Tokens (SETs) to Okta. The provider must be configured in Okta as a Security Events Provider instance before transmitting a SET to Okta. See [Create a Security Events Provider](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/SSFReceiver/#tag/SSFReceiver/operation/createSecurityEventsProviderInstance). After the token is verified, any appropriate action is performed upon ingestion.

    Okta uses the Shared Signals Framework (SSF) defined by the [OpenID Shared Signals and Events Framework specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sse-framework-1_0.html). A risk signal is ingested as a Security Event Token (SET), a type of JSON Web Token (JWT) that must comply with the SET standard: [RFC 8417 - Security Event Token(SET)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417). The `security.events.provider.receive_event` System Log event is created when a SET is published to Okta successfully.

    The SSF Transmitter API allows you to manage SSF stream configurations between the receiver that receives signals transmitted by Okta. Okta sends signals in the form of [Security Event Tokens (SETs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8417) to a third-party SSF receiver. To enable the transmission of signals from Okta, you must create an SSF Stream using the SSF Transmitter API and configure the third-party receiver to accept signals from Okta.

    The Schemas API provides operations to manage custom User profiles as well as endpoints to discover the structure of the Log Stream configuration.

    Okta's [Universal Directory](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_About_Universal_Directory) allows administrators to define custom User profiles for Okta Users and Applications.
    Okta adopts a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) as the schema language to describe and validate extensible User profiles.
    For Log Stream Schemas, Okta uses [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).
    [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) is a lightweight declarative format for describing the structure, constraints, and validation of JSON documents.

    > **Note:** Okta implements only a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) and [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).

    Okta uses a cookie-based authentication mechanism to maintain a user's authentication Session across web requests. The Okta Sessions API provides operations to create and manage authentication Sessions for users in your Okta organization.

    >**Notes:**
    > * Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows. See [Mitigate the impact of third-party cookie deprecation](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-third-party-cookies).
    > * The Sessions API doesn't support direct authentication. Direct authentication is supported through the [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#authentication-operations) or through OIDC using the [Resource Owner Password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/ropassword/main/).

    ### Session cookie

    Okta uses an HTTP session cookie to provide access to your Okta organization and applications across web requests for an interactive user agent such as a web browser. A session cookie has an expiration configurable by an administrator for the organization and is valid until the cookie expires or the user closes the Session (logout) or browser application.

    ### Session token

    A [session token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#session-token) is a one-time bearer token that provides proof of authentication and may be redeemed for an interactive SSO session in Okta in a user agent. Session tokens can only be used **once** to establish a Session for a user and are revoked when the token expires.

    Okta provides a very rich [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) to validate a [user's primary credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#primary-authentication) and secondary [MFA factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#verify-factor). A session token is returned after successful authentication, which can be later exchanged for a session cookie that uses one of the following flows:

    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting the OpenID Connect Authorization Endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-through-the-openid-connect-authorization-endpoint)
    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting a session redirect link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-a-session-redirect-link)
    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting an application embed link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-an-application-embed-link)

    >**Note:** **Session tokens** are secrets and should be protected at rest and during transit. A session token for a user is equivalent to having the user's actual credentials.

    The System Log records system events that are related to your organization in order to provide an audit trail that can be used to understand platform activity and to diagnose problems.

    The System Log API provides near real-time, read-only access to your organization's system log and is the programmatic counterpart of the [System Log UI](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Reports_SysLog).

    The terms "event" and "log event" are often used interchangeably. In the context of this API, an "event" is an occurrence of interest within the system, and a "log" or "log event" is the recorded fact.

    The System Log API supports these primary use cases:
      * Event data export into a security information and event management system (SIEM)
      * System monitoring
      * Development debugging
      * Event introspection and audit

    The System Log API isn't intended for use as a Database as a Service (DBaaS) or to serve data directly to downstream consumers without an intermediate data store.

    The SMS Templates API provides operations to manage custom SMS templates for verification.

    > **Note:** Only SMS custom Templates are available through the API.

    SMS Templates customize the SMS message that is sent to users. One default SMS Template is provided. All custom Templates must have the variable `${code}` as part of the text. The `${code}` variable is replaced with the actual SMS code when the message is sent. Optionally, you can also use the variable `${org.name}`. If a Template contains `${org.name}`, it is replaced with the organization name before the SMS message is sent.

    ### SMS Template macros

    Only two macros are supported for SMS Templates:
    | <div style="width:200px">Type</div> | Description   |
    | -------------------- | ----------- |
    | ${code}  | The one-time verification code that's required for a user to sign in. |
    | ${org.name} | The Okta org name that the user is trying to authenticate into. |

    >**Note:** The length of your SMS message can't exceed 160 characters. If the verification code portion of the message falls outside of the 160-character limit, your message isn't sent.

    * The sign-out page
    * Error pages
    * Email templates
    * The Okta End-User Dashboard

    Each new org contains Okta default branding. You can upload your own assets (colors, background image, logo, and favicon) to replace the default assets. Then you can publish these assets directly to your pages and templates.

    > **Notes:**
    > * Some of the curl code examples on this page include SSWS API token authentication. However, Okta recommends scoped OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens to authenticate with Okta management APIs. OAuth 2.0 and OIDC access tokens provide fine-grain control over the bearer's actions on specific endpoints. See [Okta API authentication methods](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-oauth/guides/overview/).
    > * Okta optimizes the `primaryColorContrastHex` and `secondaryColorContrastHex` properties for the highest contrast between the font color and the background or button color. To disable or override the contrast auto-detection, update either contrast value with an accepted contrast hex code. Any update disables future automatic optimizations for the contrast hex.

        If this request is successful for a user when DelAuth is enabled, then the user is in a state with no password. You can then reset the user's password.

        > **Important:** This is a destructive operation. You can't recover the user's app profile. If the app is enabled for provisioning and configured to deactivate users, the user is also deactivated in the target app.

        Lists all devices with pagination support.
        You can return a subset of Devices that match a supported search criteria using the `search` query parameter.
        Searches for devices based on the properties specified in the `search` parameter conforming SCIM filter specifications (case-insensitive). This data is eventually consistent. The API returns different results depending on specified queries in the request. Empty list is returned if no objects match `search` request.
        > **Note:** Listing devices with `search` should not be used as a part of any critical flows—such as authentication or updates—to prevent potential data loss. `search` results may not reflect the latest information, as this endpoint uses a search index which may not be up-to-date with recent updates to the object. <br> Don't use search results directly for record updates, as the data might be stale and therefore overwrite newer data, resulting in data loss. <br> Use an `id` lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data.
        This operation requires [URL encoding](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1). For example, `search=profile.displayName eq "Bob"` is encoded as `search=profile.displayName%20eq%20%22Bob%22`.

        Deletes (permanently) a device by `deviceId` if it has a status of `DEACTIVATED`. You can transition the device to `DEACTIVATED` status using the [Deactivate a Device](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Device/#tag/Device/operation/deactivateDevice) endpoint.
        This request is destructive and deletes all of the profile data related to the device. Once deleted, device data can't be recovered. However, reenrollment creates a new device record.

        Deactivation causes a Device to lose all device user links.
        Set the Device status to DEACTIVATED before deleting it.
        > **Note:** When deactivating a Device, keep in mind the following:
          - Device deactivation is a destructive operation for device factors and client certificates. Device reenrollment using Okta Verify allows end users to set up new factors on the device.
          - Device deletion removes the device record from Okta. Reenrollment creates a new device record.

        Creates a new event hook for your organization in `ACTIVE` status. You pass an event hook object in the JSON payload
        of your request. That object represents the set of required information about the event hook you're registering, including:
          * The URI of your external service
          * The [events](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/) in Okta you want to subscribe to
          * An optional event hook filter that can reduce the number of event hook calls. This is a self-service Early Access (EA) feature.
            See [Create an event hook filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#create-an-event-hook-filter).

            Additionally, you can specify a secret API key for Okta to pass to your external service endpoint for security verification. Note that the API key you set here is unrelated to the Okta API token
        you must supply when making calls to Okta APIs. Optionally, you can specify extra headers that Okta passes to your external
        service with each call.
        Your external service must use a valid HTTPS endpoint.

        Verifies that the event hook matches the provided `eventHookId`. To verify ownership, your endpoint must send information back to Okta in JSON format. See [Event hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#one-time-verification-request).

        Only `ACTIVE` and `VERIFIED` event hooks can receive events from Okta.

        If a response is not received within 3 seconds, the outbound request times out. One retry is attempted after a timeout or error response.
        If a successful response still isn't received, this operation returns a 400 error with more information about the failure.

        Updates a feature's lifecycle status. Use this endpoint to enable or disable a feature for your org.

        Use the `mode=force` parameter to override dependency restrictions for a particular feature. Normally, you can't enable a feature if it has one or more dependencies that aren't enabled.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while enabling a feature, Okta first tries to enable any disabled features that this feature may have as dependencies. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependencies that need to be enabled before the feature is enabled, a 400 error is returned.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while disabling a feature, Okta first tries to disable any enabled features that this feature may have as dependents. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependents that need to be disabled before the feature is disabled, a 400 error is returned.

        The following chart shows the different state transitions for a feature.

        Replaces the Log Stream object properties for a given ID.

        This operation is typically used to update the configuration of a Log Stream.
        Depending on the type of Log Stream you want to update, certain properties can't be modified after the Log Stream is initially created.
        Use the [Retrieve the Log Stream Schema for the schema type](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/getLogStreamSchema) request to determine which properties you can update for the specific Log Stream type.
        Log Stream properties with the `"writeOnce" : true` attribute can't be updated after creation.
        You must still specify these `writeOnce` properties in the request body with the original values in the PUT request.

        > **Note:** You don't have to specify properties that have both the `"writeOnce": true` and the `"writeOnly": true` attributes in the PUT request body. These property values are ignored even if you add them in the PUT request body.

        This API has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute. You can include multiple risk events (up to a maximum of 20 events) in a single payload to reduce the number of API calls. Prioritize sending high risk signals if you have a burst of signals to send that would exceed the maximum request limits.

        Creates an SSF Stream for an event receiver to start receiving security events in the form of Security Event Tokens (SETs) from Okta.

        An SSF Stream is associated with the Client ID of the OAuth 2.0 access token used to create the stream. The Client ID is provided by Okta for an [OAuth 2.0 app integration](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Apps_App_Integration_Wizard-oidc). One SSF Stream is allowed for each Client ID, hence, one SSF Stream is allowed for each app integration in Okta.

        A maximum of 10 SSF Stream configurations can be created for one org.

        Okta enforces a rate limit of five activation attempts within five minutes.
        After a user exceeds the rate limit, Okta returns an error message.

        Resends an `sms`, `call`, or `email` factor challenge as part of an enrollment flow.

        For `call` and `sms` factors, Okta enforces a rate limit of one OTP challenge per device every 30 seconds. You can configure your `sms` and `call` factors to use a third-party telephony provider. See the [Telephony inline hook reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/telephony-hook/). Okta round-robins between SMS providers with every resend request to help ensure delivery of an SMS and Call OTPs across different carriers.

        > **Note**: Resend operations aren't allowed after a factor exceeds the activation rate limit. See [Activate a Factor](./#tag/UserFactor/operation/activateFactor).

        Activates a user. This operation can only be performed on users with a `STAGED` or `DEPROVISIONED` status.
        Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation. The user will have the `transitioningToStatus`
        property with a value of `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.
        The user will have a status of `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.
        > **Multibrand and User activation**<br>
        If you want to send a branded User Activation email, change the subdomain of your request to the custom domain that's associated with the brand.
        For example, change `subdomain.okta.com` to `custom.domain.one`. See [Multibrand and custom domains](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/brands/#multibrand-and-custom-domains).
        <br><br>
        > **Legal disclaimer**<br>
        After a user is added to the Okta directory, they receive an activation email. As part of signing up for this service,
        you agreed not to use Okta's service/product to spam and/or send unsolicited messages.
        Please refrain from adding unrelated accounts to the directory as Okta is not responsible for, and disclaims any and all
        liability associated with, the activation email's content. You, and you alone, bear responsibility for the emails sent to any recipients.

            Indicates which value is specified in the issuer of the tokens that a custom authorization server returns: the Okta org domain URL or a custom domain URL.

            `issuerMode` is visible if you have a custom URL domain configured or the Dynamic Issuer Mode feature enabled. If you have a custom URL domain configured, you can set a custom domain URL in a custom authorization server, and this property is returned in the appropriate responses.

            When set to `ORG_URL`, then in responses, `issuer` is the Okta org domain URL: `https://${yourOktaDomain}`.

            When set to `CUSTOM_URL`, then in responses, `issuer` is the custom domain URL configured in the administration user interface.

            When set to `DYNAMIC`, then in responses, `issuer` is the custom domain URL if the OAuth 2.0 request was sent to the custom domain, or is the Okta org's domain URL if the OAuth 2.0 request was sent to the original Okta org domain.

            After you configure a custom URL domain, all new custom authorization servers use `CUSTOM_URL` by default. If the Dynamic Issuer Mode feature is enabled, then all new custom authorization servers use `DYNAMIC` by default. All existing custom authorization servers continue to use the original value until they're changed using the Admin Console or the API. This way, existing integrations with the client and resource server continue to work after the feature is enabled.

Each requirement must correspond to a different major version (Windows 11 or Windows 10). If a requirement isn't specified for a major version, then devices on that major version satisfy the condition.

              There are two types of OS requirements:
              * **Static**: A specific Windows version requirement that doesn't change until you update the policy. A static OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `minimum`.
              * **Dynamic**: A Windows version requirement that is relative to the latest major release and security patch. A dynamic OS Windows requirement is specified with `majorVersionConstraint` and `dynamicVersionRequirement`.

              > **Note:** Dynamic OS requirements are available only if the **Dynamic OS version compliance** [self-service EA](/openapi/okta-management/guides/release-lifecycle/#early-access-ea) feature is enabled. The `osVersionConstraints` property is only supported for the Windows platform. You can't specify both `osVersion.minimum` and `osVersionConstraints` properties at the same time.

        `key` to `Authorization`, and `value` to the Base64-encoded string of "username:password". Ensure that you include
        the scheme (including space) as part of the `value` parameter. For example, `Basic YWRtaW46c3VwZXJzZWNyZXQ=`. See
        [HTTP Basic Authentication](/books/api-security/authn/api-authentication-options/#http-basic-authentication).

        Refresh token configuration for an OAuth 2.0 client

        When you create or update an OAuth 2.0 client, you can configure refresh token rotation by setting the `rotation_type` and `leeway` properties. If you don't set these properties when you create an app integration, the default values are used.
        When you update an app integration, your previously configured values are used.
      properties:
        leeway:
          default: 30
          description: |
            The leeway, in seconds, allowed for the OAuth 2.0 client.
            After the refresh token is rotated, the previous token remains valid for the specified period of time so clients can get the new token.

            > **Note:** A leeway of 0 doesn't necessarily mean that the previous token is immediately invalidated. The previous token is invalidated after the new token is generated and returned in the response.

        The parameter is the target of a profile mapping and is a valid [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) document with the following properties. The data type can be an app instance or an Okta object.

         > **Note:** If the target is Okta and the UserTypes feature isn't enabled, then the target `_links` only has a link to the schema.
      example:
        _links: null
        name: name
        id: id

    ProfileSettingObject:
      description: |
        This setting determines whether a user in the application gets updated when they're updated in Okta.

        If enabled, Okta updates a user's attributes in the application when the application is assigned.
        Future changes made to the Okta user's profile automatically overwrite the corresponding attribute value in the application.

        okta_post_message: |-
          Uses [HTML5 Web Messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) (for example, `window.postMessage()`) instead of the redirect for the authorization response from the `/authorize` endpoint.

          `okta_post_message` is an adaptation of the [Web Message Response Mode](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sakimura-oauth-wmrm-00#section-4.1).
          This value provides a secure way for a single-page application to perform a sign-in flow in a pop-up window or an iFrame and receive the ID token, access token, and/or authorization code back in the parent page without leaving the context of that page. The data object for the `postMessage` call is in the next section.

        Sends an asynchronous push notification to the device for approval by the user. You must poll the transaction to determine the state of the activation. See [Retrieve a Factor transaction status](./#tag/UserFactor/operation/getFactorTransactionStatus).

        No request body is required for `push` Factors.

        Activations have a short lifetime of several minutes and return a `TIMEOUT` if not completed before the timestamp specified in the `expiresAt` param. Use the published activate link to restart the activation process if the activation expires.

      summary: Create an Okta Telephony Inline Hook
      description: "Creates an Okta Telephony inline hook request. This is an automated\
        \ request from Okta to your third-party service endpoint.\n\nThe objects that\
        \ you return in the JSON payload of your response to this Okta request are\
        \ an array of one or more objects,\nwhich specify the Okta commands to execute.\n\
        \n>**Note:** The size of your response payload must be less than 256 KB.\n\
        \nSee also:\n* For a general introduction to Okta inline hooks, see [Inline\
        \ hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/)\n* For information\
        \ on the API for registering external service endpoints with Okta, see [Inline\
        \ Hooks Management API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/)\n\
        * For an example implementation of a telephony inline hook, see [Telephony\
        \ inline hook ](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/telephony-inline-hook)\n\
        \n### About\n\nThe Okta telephony inline hook allows you to integrate your\
        \ own custom code into Okta flows that send SMS or voice call messages. You\
        \ can integrate this hook with enrollment, authentication, and recovery flows\
        \ that involve the phone authenticator. Okta uses your external provider to\
        \ deliver the one-time passcode (OTP) to the Requester. The provider can respond\
        \ with commands that indicate if the delivery was successful or not.\n\nYou\
        \ can have only one active telephony inline hook per org.\n\nWhen you create\
        \ a telephony inline hook, you must include the `authScheme` parameter. See\
        \ [Create inline hook](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createInlineHook)\
        \ and the [authScheme object](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createInlineHook!path=channel/0/config/authScheme&t=request)\n\
        \n### Timeout behavior\n\nIf the provider response times out, Okta attempts\
        \ to send the OTP using the Okta telephony providers. See [Troubleshoot](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/InlineHook/#tag/InlineHook/operation/createTelephonyInlineHook/#troubleshoot).\n\
        \n### Troubleshoot\n\nThis section explains several common causes of failure\
        \ for telephony inline hooks.\n\nNote: Administrators can use the [Okta System\
        \ Log](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/system-log/) to view\
        \ errors. See the Troubleshooting section in the inline hooks topic for details\
        \ on events captured by the Okta System Log.\n\n| Issue                  \
