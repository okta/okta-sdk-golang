    Users have relationships to each other, like manager and subordinate or customer and sales representative. You can create users with relationships by using the Linked Objects API to represent the relationship.

    1. Create a Linked Object definition such as Manager:Subordinate or Case Worker:Client. These pairs are represented by a `primary` attribute and an `associated` attribute.
    2. Link users together to create the relationship between the two. You create a Linked Object value with a single request that links one `primary` and one `associated` user.

    For each relationship:

    * A user has at most one `primary` link (a user has a single manager), but can have many `associated` links (a user can have many subordinates).
    * A user can be the `primary` in one relationship and the `associated` in another.
    * A user can be both the `primary` and `associated` in the same relationship.

    Okta Expression Language function for [Linked Objects](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/#linked-object-function) provides access to the details about a linked user.

    > **Note:** The Linked Objects feature isn't available for OpenID Connect claims.

    ## Example usage

    Okta allows you to create up to 200 Linked Object definitions. These definitions are one-to-many, for example:

    * A manager has many subordinates. Each subordinate has one manager.
    * A sales representative has many customers. Each customer has one sales rep.
    * A case worker has many clients. Each client has one case worker.

    Most organizations have more than one manager or sales representative. You can create the Linked Object definition once, and then assign the `primary` relationship to as many users as you have people in that relationship.

    You can assign the `associated` relationship for a single `primary` user to as many users as needed. The `associated` user can be related to only one `primary` per Linked Object definition. But a user can be assigned to more than one Linked Object definition.

    For example, assume that you've created one Linked Object definition for manager (`primary`) and for subordinates (`associated`):

    * Joe is Frank's manager.
    * Bob is Joe's manager, but Jane's subordinate.
    * Jane is the CEO, so she reports to herself.

    Thus, you can create chains of relationships (Jane > Bob > Joe > Frank) or terminal relationships (Jane is both `primary` and `associated` user).

    Then, if you create another Linked Object relationship for scrum team membership, you could assign relationships to the same four users:

    * Bob is the scrum lead for the Identity Scrum team.
    * Joe and Frank are both contributors to the team.

    Bob can be the `primary` for a Manager:Subordinate, an `associated` user for that same Linked Object definition, and also the `primary` for the Scrumlead:Contributor Linked Object definition.

    To represent a relationship, create a Linked Object definition that specifies a `primary` (parent) relationship and an `associated` (child) relationship, and then add a link in which the appropriate user is assigned to each side of that link type.

    ## Links between User Types

    If you created multiple User Types, they all share the same Linked Object definitions. For example, if you have separate User Types for employees and contractors, a link could designate an employee as the manager for a contractor, with the contractor being a subordinate of that employee.

    The Okta Network Zones API provides operations to manage Zones in your organization. There are two usage Zone types: Policy Network Zones and Blocklist Network Zones. Policy Network Zones are used to guide policy decisions. Blocklist Network Zones are used to deny access from certain IP addresses, locations, proxy types, or Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) before policy evaluation.

    A default system Policy Network Zone is provided in your Okta org. You can use the Network Zones API to modify the default Policy Network Zone or to create a custom Policy or Blocklist Network Zone. When you create your custom Zone, you can specify if the Zone is an IP Zone or a Dynamic Zone. An IP Zone allows you to define network perimeters around a set of IPs, whereas a Dynamic Zone allows you to define network perimeters around location, IP type, and ASNs.

    > **Note:** To create multiple network zones, including Dynamic Zones, you must enable Adaptive MFA.

    Role targets are a way of defining permissions for admin roles into a smaller subset of Groups or Apps within your org. Targets limit an admin's permissions to a targeted area of the org. You can define admin roles to target Groups, Applications, and Application Instances.

    * **Group targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage only a specified Group. For example, an admin role may be assigned to manage only the IT Group.
    * **App targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage all instances of the specified Apps. Target Apps are Okta catalog Apps. For example, you can have multiple configurations of an Okta catalog App, such as Salesforce or Facebook. When you add a Salesforce or Facebook App as a target, that grants the admin permission to manage all the instances of those Apps and create new instances of them.
    * **App Instance targets:** Grant an admin permission to manage an instance of one App or instances of multiple Apps. App Instances are specific Apps that admins have created in their org. For example, there may be a Salesforce App configured differently for each sales region of a company. When you create an App Instance target, you can assign an admin to manage only two instances of the configured Salesforce Apps and then also to manage an instance of another configured App such as Workday.

    > **Note:** Don't use these operations with a Custom Role ID. Custom Role assignments always require a target Resource Set. See [Role Assignments](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/role-assignment/) for more information.

    Okta adopts a subset of [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) as the schema language to describe and validate extensible User profiles.
    For Log Stream Schemas, Okta uses [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification.html).

    Okta uses a cookie-based authentication mechanism to maintain a user's authentication Session across web requests. The Okta Sessions API provides operations to create and manage authentication Sessions for users in your Okta organization.

    >**Note:** Some browsers block third-party cookies by default, which disrupts Okta functionality in certain flows. See [FAQ: How Blocked Third Party Cookies Can Potentially Impact Your Okta Environment](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/FAQ-How-Blocking-Third-Party-Cookies-Can-Potentially-Impact-Your-Okta-Environment).

    >**Note:** The Sessions API doesn't support direct authentication. Direct authentication is supported through the [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#authentication-operations) or through OIDC using the [Resource Owner Password flow](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/ropassword/main/).

    ### Session cookie

    Okta uses an HTTP session cookie to provide access to your Okta organization and applications across web requests for an interactive user agent such as a web browser. A session cookie has an expiration configurable by an administrator for the organization and is valid until the cookie expires or the user closes the Session (logout) or browser application.

    ### Session token

    A [session token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#session-token) is a one-time bearer token that provides proof of authentication and may be redeemed for an interactive SSO session in Okta in a user agent. Session tokens can only be used **once** to establish a Session for a user and are revoked when the token expires.

    Okta provides a very rich [Authentication API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/) to validate a [user's primary credentials](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#primary-authentication) and secondary [MFA factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#verify-factor). A session token is returned after successful authentication, which can be later exchanged for a session cookie that uses one of the following flows:

    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting the OpenID Connect Authorization Endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-through-the-openid-connect-authorization-endpoint)
    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting a session redirect link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-a-session-redirect-link)
    - [Retrieve a session cookie by visiting an application embed link](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/session-cookie/main/#retrieve-a-session-cookie-by-visiting-an-application-embed-link)

    >**Note:** **Session tokens** are secrets and should be protected at rest and during transit. A session token for a user is equivalent to having the user's actual credentials.

    The System Log records system events that are related to your organization in order to provide an audit trail that can be used to understand platform activity and to diagnose problems.

    The System Log API provides near real-time, read-only access to your organization's system log and is the programmatic counterpart of the [System Log UI](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Reports_SysLog).

    The terms "event" and "log event" are often used interchangeably. In the context of this API, an "event" is an occurrence of interest within the system, and a "log" or "log event" is the recorded fact.

    The System Log API supports these primary use cases:
      * Event data export into a security information and event management system (SIEM)
      * System monitoring
      * Development debugging
      * Event introspection and audit

    The System Log API isn't intended for use as a Database as a Service (DBaaS) or to serve data directly to downstream consumers without an intermediate data store.

        Lists all devices with pagination support.
        You can return a subset of Devices that match a supported search criteria using the `search` query parameter.
        Searches for devices based on the properties specified in the `search` parameter conforming SCIM filter specifications (case-insensitive). This data is eventually consistent. The API returns different results depending on specified queries in the request. Empty list is returned if no objects match `search` request.
        > **Note:** Listing devices with `search` should not be used as a part of any critical flows—such as authentication or updates—to prevent potential data loss. `search` results may not reflect the latest information, as this endpoint uses a search index which may not be up-to-date with recent updates to the object. <br> Don't use search results directly for record updates, as the data might be stale and therefore overwrite newer data, resulting in data loss. <br> Use an `id` lookup for records that you update to ensure your results contain the latest data.
        This operation requires [URL encoding](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1). For example, `search=profile.displayName eq "Bob"` is encoded as `search=profile.displayName%20eq%20%22Bob%22`.

        Creates a new event hook for your organization in `ACTIVE` status. You pass an event hook object in the JSON payload
        of your request. That object represents the set of required information about the event hook you're registering, including:
          * The URI of your external service
          * The [events](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/) in Okta you want to subscribe to
          * An optional event hook filter that can reduce the number of event hook calls. This is a self-service Early Access (EA) feature.
            See [Create an event hook filter](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#create-an-event-hook-filter).

            Additionally, you can specify a secret API key for Okta to pass to your external service endpoint for security verification. Note that the API key you set here is unrelated to the Okta API token
        you must supply when making calls to Okta APIs. Optionally, you can specify extra headers that Okta passes to your external
        service with each call.
        Your external service must use a valid HTTPS endpoint.

        Verifies that the event hook matches the provided `eventHookId`. To verify ownership, your endpoint must send information back to Okta in JSON format. See [Event hooks](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/#one-time-verification-request).

        Only `ACTIVE` and `VERIFIED` event hooks can receive events from Okta.

        If a response is not received within 3 seconds, the outbound request times out. One retry is attempted after a timeout or error response.
        If a successful response still isn't received, this operation returns a 400 error with more information about the failure.

        Updates a feature's lifecycle status. Use this endpoint to enable or disable a feature for your org.

        Use the `mode=force` parameter to override dependency restrictions for a particular feature. Normally, you can't enable a feature if it has one or more dependencies that aren't enabled.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while enabling a feature, Okta first tries to enable any disabled features that this feature may have as dependencies. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependencies that need to be enabled before the feature is enabled, a 400 error is returned.

        When you use the `mode=force` parameter while disabling a feature, Okta first tries to disable any enabled features that this feature may have as dependents. If you don't pass the `mode=force` parameter and the feature has dependents that need to be disabled before the feature is disabled, a 400 error is returned.

        Replaces the Log Stream object properties for a given ID.

        This operation is typically used to update the configuration of a Log Stream.
        Depending on the type of Log Stream you want to update, certain properties can't be modified after the Log Stream is initially created.
        Use the [Retrieve the Log Stream Schema for the schema type](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Schema/#tag/Schema/operation/getLogStreamSchema) request to determine which properties you can update for the specific Log Stream type.
        Log Stream properties with the `"writeOnce" : true` attribute can't be updated after creation.
        You must still specify these `writeOnce` properties in the request body with the original values in the PUT request.

        > **Note:** You don't have to specify properties that have both the `"writeOnce": true` and the `"writeOnly": true` attributes in the PUT request body. These property values are ignored even if you add them in the PUT request body.

        Lists all profile mappings in your organization with [pagination](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/#pagination). You can return a subset of profile mappings that match a supported `sourceId` and/or `targetId`.
        The results are [paginated](/#pagination) according to the limit parameter. If there are multiple pages of results, the Link header contains a `next` link that should be treated as an opaque value (follow it, don't parse it).

        The response is a collection of profile mappings that include a subset of the profile mapping object's parameters. The profile mapping object describes
        the properties mapping between an Okta User and an App User Profile using [JSON Schema Draft 4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04).

        Sends multiple IP risk events to Okta.
        This request is used by a third-party risk provider to send IP risk events to Okta. The third-party risk provider needs to be registered with Okta before they can send events to Okta. See [Risk Providers](/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/RiskProvider/).
        This API has a rate limit of 30 requests per minute. You can include multiple risk events (up to a maximum of 20 events) in a single payload to reduce the number of API calls. Prioritize sending high risk signals if you have a burst of signals to send that would exceed the maximum request limits.

        Resends an `sms`, `call`, or `email` factor challenge as part of an enrollment flow.

        For `call` and `sms` factors, Okta enforces a rate limit of one OTP challenge per device every 30 seconds. You can configure your `sms` and `call` factors to use a third-party telephony provider. See the [Telephony inline hook reference](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/telephony-hook/). Okta round-robins between SMS providers with every resend request to help ensure delivery of an SMS and Call OTPs across different carriers.

        > **Note**: Resend operations aren't allowed after a factor exceeds the activation rate limit. See [Activate a Factor](./#tag/UserFactor/operation/activateFactor).

        Activates a user. This operation can only be performed on users with a `STAGED` or `DEPROVISIONED` status.
        Activation of a user is an asynchronous operation. The user will have the `transitioningToStatus`
        property with a value of `ACTIVE` during activation to indicate that the user hasn't completed the asynchronous operation.
        The user will have a status of `ACTIVE` when the activation process is complete.
        > **Multibrand and User activation**<br>
        If you want to send a branded User Activation email, change the subdomain of your request to the custom domain that's associated with the brand.
        For example, change `subdomain.okta.com` to `custom.domain.one`. See [Multibrand and custom domains](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/brands/#multibrand-and-custom-domains).

        > **Legal disclaimer**<br>
        After a user is added to the Okta directory, they receive an activation email. As part of signing up for this service,
        you agreed not to use Okta's service/product to spam and/or send unsolicited messages.
        Please refrain from adding unrelated accounts to the directory as Okta is not responsible for, and disclaims any and all
        liability associated with, the activation email's content. You, and you alone, bear responsibility for the emails sent to any recipients.

        Lists all network zones with pagination. A subset of zones can be returned that match a supported filter expression or query.

        This operation requires URL encoding. For example, `filter=(id eq "nzoul0wf9jyb8xwZm0g3" or id eq "nzoul1MxmGN18NDQT0g3")` is encoded as `filter=%28id+eq+%22nzoul0wf9jyb8xwZm0g3%22+or+id+eq+%22nzoul1MxmGN18NDQT0g3%22%29`.

        Okta supports filtering on the `id` and `usage` properties. See [Filtering](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/#filter) for more information on the expressions that are used in filtering.

        Refresh token configuration for an OAuth 2.0 client

        When you create or update an OAuth 2.0 client, you can configure refresh token rotation by setting the `rotation_type` and `leeway` properties. If you don't set these properties when you create an app integration, the default values are used.
        When you update an app integration, your previously configured values are used.
      properties:
        leeway:
          default: 30
          description: |
            The leeway, in seconds, allowed for the OAuth 2.0 client.
            After the refresh token is rotated, the previous token remains valid for the specified period of time so clients can get the new token.

            > **Note:** A leeway of 0 doesn't necessarily mean that the previous token is immediately invalidated. The previous token is invalidated after the new token is generated and returned in the response.
