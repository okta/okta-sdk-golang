## Methods

### NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess

`func NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess() *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess`

NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess instantiates a new ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccessWithDefaults

`func NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccessWithDefaults() *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess`

This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetFailureActions

`func (o *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess) GetFailureActions() []ContinuousAccessFailureActionsObject`

GetFailureActions returns the FailureActions field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetFailureActionsOk

`func (o *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess) GetFailureActionsOk() (*[]ContinuousAccessFailureActionsObject, bool)`

GetFailureActionsOk returns a tuple with the FailureActions field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetFailureActions

`func (o *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess) SetFailureActions(v []ContinuousAccessFailureActionsObject)`

SetFailureActions sets FailureActions field to given value.

### HasFailureActions
