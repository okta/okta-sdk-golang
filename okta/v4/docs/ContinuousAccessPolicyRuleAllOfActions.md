## Methods

### NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions

`func NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions() *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions`

NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions instantiates a new ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsWithDefaults

`func NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsWithDefaults() *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions`

NewContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsWithDefaults instantiates a new ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetContinuousAccess

`func (o *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions) GetContinuousAccess() ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess`

GetContinuousAccess returns the ContinuousAccess field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetContinuousAccessOk

`func (o *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions) GetContinuousAccessOk() (*ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess, bool)`

GetContinuousAccessOk returns a tuple with the ContinuousAccess field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetContinuousAccess

`func (o *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions) SetContinuousAccess(v ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActionsContinuousAccess)`

SetContinuousAccess sets ContinuousAccess field to given value.

### HasContinuousAccess

`func (o *ContinuousAccessPolicyRuleAllOfActions) HasContinuousAccess() bool`

HasContinuousAccess returns a boolean if a field has been set.
